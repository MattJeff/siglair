//! One error type for the whole HTTP surface, rendered as RFC 9457
//! `application/problem+json`.
//!
//! Two rules, and they are the whole module:
//!
//! 1. **Nothing a handler failed with is echoed to the caller.** Not the sqlx
//!    error, not the constraint name, not the policy limits the action broke.
//!    The client gets a status, a stable `code`, and a title. The operator gets
//!    the same `code` plus the real cause, on a `tracing` event, at the moment
//!    the error is constructed. That split is why the [`From`] impls log: the
//!    log line is the last place the detail exists.
//! 2. **`code` is a closed vocabulary.** It is `&'static str`, so it cannot be
//!    a formatted message, so a dashboard keyed on it cannot silently stop
//!    counting because somebody reworded a sentence.
//!
//! `detail` exists for the cases where the caller genuinely needs to know what
//! *they* did wrong — a malformed idempotency key, a body that is not JSON.
//! It is never filled from a server-side error.
