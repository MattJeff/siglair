//! The outbox poller. This is what replaces the broker.
//!
//! ```text
//! admin tx:   claim(BATCH, now) ; COMMIT      <- cross-tenant, takes the lease
//!   per event:
//!     tenant tx:  handler(event, tx) ; mark_done ; COMMIT
//!     on failure: admin tx ; mark_failed ; COMMIT
//! sleep(IDLE) unless the batch came back full
//! ```
//!
//! Everything interesting about *claiming* — `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, the
//! exponential backoff with jitter, the attempt counter that dead-letters a
//! poison message instead of spinning on it — lives in
//! [`agentos_store::outbox`] and is one SQL statement there. This module is the
//! part that cannot be SQL: pick a handler, give it a transaction, decide what
//! the outcome means.
//!
//! # Two transactions, and which work goes in which
//!
//! The claim commits before any handler runs. It has to: `SKIP LOCKED` only
//! hides a row for as long as the claiming transaction is open, so holding it
//! across a handler would mean holding a row lock across a network call to a
//! provider. What keeps the row to one worker instead is that the claim pushed
//! `available_at` into the future — a lease that expires by itself, so a poller
//! that dies mid-handler hands the row back without a reaper.
//!
//! The handler then runs in a **tenant** transaction, not the admin one. The
//! poller is cross-tenant by nature, but the work it dispatches is not: opening
//! `tenant_tx(event.tenant_id)` puts `app.tenant_id` back in place so a handler
//! reads and writes under row-level security exactly like a request handler
//! does. `mark_done` runs inside that same transaction — `app_role` has UPDATE
//! on `outbox_events` and the row is the tenant's own — so the effect's
//! bookkeeping and its state change commit together or not at all.
//!
//! Delivery is at-least-once, and that is the honest ceiling: a process killed
//! between a provider accepting an email and the `COMMIT` will send it twice.
//! Handlers are expected to be idempotent (`provider_intents` exists for
//! exactly this). Exactly-once would need the provider to be in the
//! transaction, which it is not.
//!
//! # Clock
//!
//! [`tick`] takes `now` rather than reading the clock, so the backoff schedule
//! is testable by advancing an argument instead of sleeping through two hours
//! of it. [`run`] is the only thing here that calls `Utc::now`.
