//! The provisioning loop, the reaper that stops an employee rotting in
//! `pending_external`, and the sweeper that stops a terminated one being billed
//! forever.
//!
//! One tokio task. Every ~200ms it claims a batch of resource rows that want
//! work, hands each employee to [`agentos_app::provisioning::ProvisioningEngine`]
//! — which is what actually runs `ensure_step` per step, in dependency order,
//! under a lease — escalates anything whose external wait has run out of
//! patience, and then re-runs the release for terminated employees that still
//! hold something.
//!
//! # The termination sweep
//!
//! Termination releases resources from an `employee.terminated` outbox event.
//! A provider that is transiently down fails that handler, the outbox retries
//! it on its own backoff, and after eight attempts the event is **dead
//! lettered** — at which point nothing in the system ever tries again. The
//! phone number stays bought, the invoice keeps arriving, and the only trace is
//! a row nobody reads.
//!
//! So [`sweep`] is the standing question "is anybody still holding something
//! they were told to give back", asked of the database rather than of an event:
//!
//! | rule                                      | why |
//! |-------------------------------------------|-----|
//! | `lifecycle = 'terminated'` and bound      | the resource is real and still billed |
//! | never `release_not_supported`             | **structural**, not transient — see below |
//! | `release_attempt_count`, `release_attempted_at` | the release's **own** budget, not provisioning's |
//! | one attempt past the cap escalates        | a human is asked once, then the sweep goes quiet |
//! | a `step` this build cannot name escalates **at once** | there is no adapter to retry, so waiting for the cap is only silence |
//! | `FOR UPDATE ... SKIP LOCKED`              | two replicas do not both call the provider |
//!
//! **`release_not_supported` is never retried.** Resend's sending domain is
//! shared across the tenant, so the adapter refuses to delete it on purpose and
//! will refuse identically forever; retrying would spend a provider call and
//! re-fire an operator alert on every tick for the life of the deployment. The
//! row keeps its binding and its reason and stays out of the retry set, and
//! `agentos_store::provisioning::stranded` is where an operator reads the list
//! of what they have to go and cancel by hand.
//!
//! **Nothing here can resurrect a terminated employee.** The sweep reaches
//! `release_steps` and nothing else — never `converge`, never `ensure_step` —
//! and [`load_terminated`] refuses to hand an employee to the release path
//! unless it really is terminated. That matters because a released row lands in
//! `disabled`, `disabled` *is* claimable, and converging a terminated employee
//! once re-provisioned all eleven steps and bought a fresh phone number.
//!
//! # What counts as work
//!
//! Four predicates, in [`CLAIM_SQL`], and each one is a different failure:
//!
//! | row                                            | why it is work |
//! |------------------------------------------------|----------------|
//! | `pending`                                      | never attempted |
//! | `provisioning` and `lease_until < now`         | **a worker died holding it** |
//! | `pending_external` and `expected_by < now`     | **the wait is now a problem** |
//! | `failed`, cold for `retry_after`, under the cap, **and with a retryable code** | a transient failure |
//!
//! The last four words of that row are new, and they are the difference between
//! "a step failed" and "a step failed at something a second call could fix". A
//! terminal code — `bad_secret_ref`, `no_numbers_available`, `unauthorized` —
//! used to buy five provider calls apiece on a backoff, which is the release
//! side's `release_not_supported` bug in the other direction and it went
//! unnoticed for exactly as long. See [`CLAIM_SQL`].
//!
//! ...and one exemption: **a stopped company's rows are not claimed, unless the
//! row is the second one.** A halt, or an operating window that has run out,
//! defers everything that has not started buying; the lapsed lease is the one
//! row that has, and stranding it is the failure `routes::halt` warns about.
//! [`CLAIM_SQL`] carries the whole argument and the table it turns on.
//!
//! The second row is the recovery case and the reason this query is not simply
//! "state = 'pending'". A worker that was killed mid-step leaves the row in
//! `provisioning` with its own lease on it; nothing else in the system ever
//! looks at that row again, so if the loop did not claim it the employee would
//! sit half-provisioned forever. Re-claiming it is safe because
//! `agentos_store::provisioning::claim_step` treats a lapsed lease as stealable
//! and the engine parks — rather than retries — any step whose provider call
//! may already have landed.
//!
//! # The lock is a formality; the lease is the claim
//!
//! [`CLAIM_SQL`] takes `FOR UPDATE ... SKIP LOCKED` so two replicas polling in
//! the same instant do not pick the same batch, and then **commits before
//! converging**. It has to: the engine's own `claim_step` takes `SELECT ... FOR
//! UPDATE` on the very same row, so holding the discovery lock across the
//! engine call would have this task waiting on a lock it holds itself — an
//! application-level deadlock that no database detects. Real mutual exclusion
//! between workers is the lease on `employee_resources`, which expires by
//! itself; the row lock only narrows the window in which two pollers do
//! redundant work.
//!
//! # traceparent, and why there is none
//!
//! This loop used to read a W3C `traceparent` back out of `outbox_events`,
//! put it on the span and stamp it onto the events the run produced. The
//! sentence that justified it — *the trace recorded by whoever caused the
//! work* — described a writer that does not exist and never did:
//! `agentos_store::outbox::NewEvent::traceparent` is set to `Some` at exactly
//! two call sites in the workspace, both inside that module's own test module,
//! and `store::provisioning`'s own INSERT builds its payload without the key.
//! The only other writer was this loop's `stamp_trace`, which ran only once the
//! read had already found something — a chain with no first link, so the read
//! returned `NULL` on every deployment there is.
//!
//! It was not free. The read was a correlated subquery in `CLAIM_SQL`'s target
//! list over `aggregate_id`, a column no index in `outbox_events` leads with,
//! under `admin_tx_bypassing_rls` so with no tenant qual and no `published_at`
//! qual — one sequential scan of every event the deployment had ever written,
//! per claimed row, per 200ms tick. 423.9 ms at a batch of 32 against 100 005
//! rows; `claiming_work_does_not_read_the_outbox` is what keeps it out.
//!
//! Wiring it for real is a request-boundary job, not a loop one: something has
//! to extract `traceparent` from the inbound request and set it on the
//! `NewEvent` the POST enqueues. There is no OpenTelemetry dependency and no
//! header extraction in this workspace, so that is a product decision with a
//! dependency attached rather than a line of code, and it belongs to whoever
//! takes it. `NewEvent::traceparent` and `OutboxEvent::traceparent()` are left
//! in place as the door it would come through.
//!
//! # Shutdown
//!
//! The token is checked *between* employees and never during one. Cancelling
//! mid-call is precisely the crash that leaves an intent of unknown outcome
//! behind, which costs a human a reconciliation; finishing the employee in
//! flight costs a few seconds of drain.

///
/// # `failed` was never one thing, and the cap was pricing it as if it were
///
/// The fourth predicate used to read "failed, cold, under the cap" and stop
/// there, so `bad_secret_ref`, `no_numbers_available`, `unauthorized` and every
/// other terminal refusal bought [`LoopConfig::max_attempts`] provider calls
/// each — the same answer, five times, on a backoff, for a step whose own
/// `call_until` had already refused to retry it once inside the pass. The
/// release side of this very file has had the corresponding guard since it
/// existed (`SWEEP_SQL`, and `RELEASE_NOT_SUPPORTED` is bound into it); the
/// converge side did not.
///
/// `$5` is [`agentos_providers::RETRYABLE_CODES`] — bound, never spelled here,
/// for the reason that constant's own docs give. `last_error` on a failed row is
/// `format!("{}: {err}", err.code())` (`ProvisioningEngine::ensure_step`), so
/// `split_part(…, ':', 1)` is the code and nothing else; no provider code
/// contains a colon.
///
/// **NULL `last_error` stays claimable, and that is the safe direction.** It is
/// not "no code we recognise" — it is a row that never carried a provider
/// verdict at all: the reaper's `pending_external -> failed`, whose whole point
/// is that the wait ended and the step should be tried again, and every row
/// written before this predicate existed. Reading NULL as terminal would park
/// those silently, which is the failure mode this change must not become.
///
/// ponytail: an employee claimed for a *retryable* row still converges its
/// terminal steps in the same pass, because `converge` walks all eleven. The
/// ceiling is one extra call per terminal step per genuine retry, not five per
/// tick; closing it means carrying `last_error` into `domain::ResourceStatus`
/// so `ensure_step` can park on it, and that is a domain change to buy a
/// rounding error.
/// # The stop, and exactly how far it reaches
///
/// The last clause is [`not_stopped!`](agentos_store::not_stopped), the same
/// fragment `outbox::claim_of` and `initiative::claim_due` use, correlated on
/// `r.tenant_id` because this query is driven by the queue table rather than by
/// `tenants`. It **defers**: a row that is not selected is not written, so
/// `attempt_count`, `updated_at` and `expected_by` are all exactly what they
/// were, and the tick after the halt is lifted or the window extended finds
/// them due again with nobody's help. That is the same property
/// `initiative::claim_due` holds by leaving `next_at` in the past.
///
/// **The `OR` in front of it is the whole judgement, so it is written down.**
/// `routes::halt` argues that stopping this loop half-way is worse than not
/// stopping it, because interrupting a convergence leaves resources bought and
/// unbound. That argument is right, and it is about *interrupting*. It does not
/// cover *not starting*, and the two are different rows:
///
/// | state | is there a provider call to be uncertain about? |
/// |-------|--------------------------------------------------|
/// | `pending` | no — `claim_step` never ran, so there is no `provider_intents` row at all |
/// | `failed` | no — `finish_step` closed the intent `failed`; a retry is a *fresh* purchase |
/// | `pending_external` | not one we can affect — `ensure_step` returns from this state without touching anything, and the reaper below only files an approval |
/// | `provisioning`, lease lapsed | **yes** — `claim_step` commits the intent *before* the call, so this row is a call whose outcome nobody knows |
///
/// So the fourth row is exempted from the stop and the other three are not.
/// That exemption is not politeness: `ProvisioningEngine::claim` is the only
/// thing in this workspace that closes an orphaned intent —
/// `sweep_expired_leases` and `mark_intent_orphaned` have one call site each,
/// both inside it, reachable only through `converge`, reachable only from this
/// loop. Deferring that row would leave the intent `in_flight` for the length
/// of the stop and leave the human who has to reconcile a possibly-bought phone
/// number unasked. That is precisely the stranded stock `routes::halt`
/// describes, and precisely what this clause refuses to create.
///
/// **What it does not buy back.** `converge` takes an employee, not a step, so
/// an employee exempted for its one lapsed lease has *all eleven* of its steps
/// run, pending ones included. The frontier is therefore per employee and not
/// per row, and closing that last gap needs a `converge` that accepts a step
/// list — the resumable state machine `routes::halt` says is not this unit, and
/// it still is not. It is strictly less spend than before this clause existed,
/// which is the bar every stop in this workspace is held to.
///
/// Measured, so the next reader does not have to: the planner turns both
/// `NOT EXISTS` into **hashed subplans** — one scan of each of the two
/// one-row-per-company tables per execution, not a probe per candidate row — so
/// the clause costs the same whether the batch scans ten rows or ten thousand.
///
/// FOUNDER'S QUESTION, LEFT OPEN, and it is `outbox::claim_of`'s question word
/// for word: a halt has `DELETE /v1/halt`, but a window that ended has no
/// release verb, so a finished company's eleven pending resources now wait here
/// forever. Deferred is the conservative half — nothing is lost, extending the

/// without checking the deadline. Two questions, two clauses, neither is the

/// and carries its own founder's question about it.
///
/// # FOUNDER'S QUESTION: nobody has chosen a reminder cadence
///
/// Once a lapsed row stops suppressing, the step escalates again — and what
/// bounds that is not a reminder policy, because there is no reminder policy.
/// It is two numbers chosen for other reasons:
///
/// * **how many times**: [`LoopConfig::max_attempts`], whose docstring is about
///   provider calls ("give up retrying a step after this many claims"). The
///   `failed` arm of [`CLAIM_SQL`] is capped by it, so one step buys at most
///   `max_attempts` more trips through `pending_external` and therefore at most
///   that many more escalations, then goes quiet for good.
/// * **how far apart**: the provider's own `expected_by`. Twilio decides how
///   long a regulatory bundle sits in review, so it decides the gap between one
///   reminder and the next.
///
/// The founder's queue therefore gets up to `max_attempts` rows for one step
/// over its life, each naming a *different* `poll_ref` — a different
/// re-submission that also failed. That is a log rather than a repetition, which
/// is why nothing here dedupes across it. But "five reminders, spaced by
/// Twilio" is an accident of two unrelated knobs, and if the answer should be
/// "one a week until somebody clicks" that is an interval this file will not
/// invent. The knob it would go on is [`LoopConfig`].
