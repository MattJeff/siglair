//! One binary: the HTTP control plane plus the tokio loops spawned in `main` —
//! the MCP binder, provisioning, outbox, inbound and initiative. No separate
//! worker binaries. The list is here and the count is not, because the count
//! was here and said four for as long as the MCP binder has existed.
//!
//! # The middleware stack, and why the order is the order
//!
//! Defined once, in [`with_outer_stack`] and [`with_api_stack`], because a
//! stack assembled per-router is a stack that is missing a layer on one router.
//!
//! ```text
//! request-id → trace → body limit → timeout → auth → rate limit → idempotency
//! ```
//!
//! * **request-id first** so every log line below it, including the trace
//!   layer's own, carries the same id. An id minted after tracing is an id
//!   that is not on the line you are reading.
//! * **body limit before timeout** so a 10 GB upload is refused on the first
//!   chunk instead of being read for thirty seconds and then refused.
//! * **auth before rate limit** because the rate limit is *per tenant*, and
//!   there is no tenant until the key has been checked. The other order gives
//!   an unauthenticated caller a way to consume a tenant's budget.
//! * **idempotency last**, i.e. innermost, so a replayed request is answered
//!   without running the handler but *after* it has been authenticated and
//!   counted. An idempotency layer above auth would let anyone read back
//!   another tenant's stored response.
//!
//! `/livez` and `/readyz` sit outside the API stack: a probe that needs a
//! credential is a probe that reports an outage the day the keyring is
//! misconfigured.

/// The whole HTTP surface.
///
/// Two tiers, and which router goes in which is a security decision:
///
/// * **inside `with_api_stack`** — everything a *customer* calls. Auth, then
///   the per-tenant rate limit, then idempotency.
/// * **outside it, inside `with_outer_stack`** — everything a *stranger*
///   calls: provider webhooks, which carry a signature instead of an API key;
///   the A2A agent card, which is the document a peer fetches before it has
///   anything at all; the OAuth callback, which a *browser* is redirected to
///   holding no key; and the key directory a verifier fetches to check a
///   signature of ours. They still get a request id, a trace, the body limit
///   and the timeout.
///
/// ponytail: the rate limiter is *not* on that second tier, and cannot be —
/// it is keyed on the tenant from the credential, and there is no credential
/// there. Every route on it is one INSERT or one indexed lookup behind a hard
/// body cap; a per-source limit belongs at the ingress proxy, which is also the
/// only thing that can see the real client address.
///
/// This used to say "both routes", and the tier grew to four while the sentence
/// stayed at two. The bound is what the sentence is really claiming, so it is
/// now stated as a bound rather than as a count — `routes::webhooks` costs one
/// primary-key lookup on an unregistered path, `routes::mcp::public_router`
/// costs one lookup on the `state` parameter and 404s on everything else, and
/// the two documents are selects. A route that cannot say that about itself
/// does not belong here.
/// Everything the model-connection route needs, and nothing any other route
/// does.
///
/// **A struct because two branches added a parameter to `app` on the same day**
/// and clippy counted eight. Grouping what travels together is the honest fix:
/// the host's own `llm` is read by exactly the two `.merge` calls below and by
/// nothing else, so a bag of it is a fact about the wiring rather than a way to
/// quiet a lint.
///
/// It held the deployment's `SecretStore` too, until `0050_tenant_model_key`
/// moved the tenant's model credential into the row that claims it. What both
/// routes need now is the cipher — and that already arrives as `credentials`,
/// for `routes::mcp`, so passing a second handle would have been the two-ciphers
/// bug this file warns about one screen up.
///
/// It is deliberately *not* `Ports`. `Ports` is what an employee acts through;
/// this is what the operator's onboarding call uses to prove a tenant's key
/// before any employee exists — see `routes::model` for why that ordering is
/// the whole point.

/// a crash anywhere in here re-run the whole thing rather than half of it.

/// That is also why the thread is written here and not later: the thread **is**

///    `db.migrate()` *before* `TcpListener::bind`, so on this deployment nothing
///    can reach `/readyz` un-migrated at all. The query-level check is what
///    survives someone later deciding to migrate out of band.
/// 2. **Is there a platform policy ceiling?** The gate is fail-closed: with no
///    ceiling `policy::load` returns `NoPlatformLayer` and *every* action for
///    *every* tenant is denied. A replica in that state passes a connection
///    check, serves 200s, and refuses all the work — which is the precise shape
///    of an outage nobody pages on. `main` warns about it at boot; this is what
///    keeps the replica out of the load balancer until somebody acts on the
///    warning. The reason string is `gate.rs`'s own deny code, so the probe and
///    the metric an operator is staring at say the same word.
/// 3. **Is the outbox draining?** A wedged outbox means side effects are being
///    accepted and not performed, which is worse than refusing the request.
///
/// A mock adapter is deliberately **not** one of them. A development box has to
/// be able to come up, so `mock_adapters` is reported and never fails the
/// probe — an always-present field, empty on a fully real deployment, so an
/// operator can diff two replicas rather than infer from a silence.
///
/// `payment_rail` is reported on the same terms and for the same reason: a
/// deployment with no `PaymentProvider` is a legitimate deployment — every
/// build in this workspace is one — that simply refuses `payment_create` at
