//! `agentos-server policy` — every row that decides what an employee may do,
//! written and undone without a database console.
//!
//! The gate is fail-closed: with no `platform` layer `store::policy::load`
//! answers `NoPlatformLayer`, every action for every tenant is denied, `main`
//! warns at boot and `/readyz` refuses. Everything about that was already true
//! and visible. What did not exist was a way to *fix* it — when this module was
//! written no route wrote `policy_layers` at all — so a fresh install could not
//! be made to work without hand-written SQL. This is that missing half.
//!
//! One route writes `policy_layers` now: `POST /v1/companies`, and only where
//! the tenant has no such layer (`409 role_layer_exists` otherwise). "Both
//! arguments survived, and it turned out they were about *replacing*" below is
//! the whole story; the sentence above is kept in the past tense rather than
//! deleted because it is why this module exists.
//!
//! Four verbs, and each closes a step `docs/ORIZN.md` used to have to spell as
//! `psql`:
//!
//! | verb | the row nothing else wrote when this was written |
//! |---|---|
//! | `install <ceiling.json>` | the platform ceiling |
//! | `new-tenant <slug> <name>` | the `tenants` row **and** its active `policy_versions` row |
//! | `install --tenant … [--role …\|--employee …] <layer.json>` | a tenant, role or employee layer |
//! | `rollback [--tenant …]` | the undo for either |
//!
//! # Why a subcommand and not a route
//!
//! A route would be reachable, scriptable and consistent with the rest of this
//! server, and it is still the wrong shape here.
//!
//! **Every route in this binary derives its tenant from the API key.** That is
//! the whole authorisation model: `auth::require_api_key` turns a bearer token
//! into a `Principal { tenant_id }`, `Db::tenant_tx` pins the transaction to it,
//! and RLS enforces it in Postgres. The platform layer belongs to *no tenant* —
//! `tenant_id IS NULL`, deliberately, and `0006_policy.sql`'s WITH CHECK clause
//! makes it unwritable from any tenant transaction. So a route that installed
//! one would have to open an admin transaction on the strength of a credential
//! that means "I am tenant X", and the write it performs binds every *other*
//! tenant. That is a privilege escalation with a JSON body, and the mitigation
//! would have to be a second class of credential — a platform key, its own
//! keyring, its own rotation story, its own 401 path, and a new way to be
//! misconfigured on a surface that is by definition internet-reachable. The
//! honest version of "authorise a platform write" is not a header. It is
//! "prove you are the operator", and the proof this deployment already has is
//! the database credential.
//!
//! **That second class of credential now exists, and the ceiling is still not a
//! route.** `AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEYS` and `crate::routes::platform` were built for
//! the one platform write that could not stay in a shell — issuing a customer's
//! first API key, because a customer filling in a form cannot ssh anywhere. Every
//! cost this paragraph listed was paid: a second keyring, a second 401 path, a
//! second way to be misconfigured. What did not change is which side of the line
//! the *ceiling* falls on, and the reason is not that no principal could be
//! authenticated for it:
//!
//! * **Issuing a key cannot widen anything.** The row it writes is a credential
//!   for one tenant, bounded by exactly the policy that tenant already had. The
//!   ceiling is the only row in this schema that makes *every* tenant able to do
//!   more, and rolling one back is the one operation in this file that genuinely
//!   widens.
//! * **A ceiling is a document, not a call.** `install` reads a JSON file and
//!   refuses one that omits a field, because an omitted field is DENY and not
//!   "leave it alone" — see [`parse_limits_document`]. That check exists where an
//!   operator's *file* is read, and a route would be a second place for the
//!   belief it refuses.
//!
//! So the widest thing this deployment can do stays behind the credential that
//! is hardest to hold and impossible to hold by accident. If a hosted control
//! plane ever needs to widen a customer's ceiling without shell access, the
//! principal to build it on is `auth::PlatformPrincipal` and the function is
//! [`policy::install_ceiling`] — but read the two bullets above before deciding
//! that is what is wanted.
//!
//! **A subcommand runs on exactly that credential.** `DATABASE_URL`, an admin
//! transaction, no new authorisation concept, and nothing added to the HTTP
//! surface for an attacker to find. It is the same shape as `doctor`, for the
//! same reason.
//!
//! The real cost of a subcommand is that it is one more thing to forget, and
//! forgetting it is the failure this exists to prevent. That cost is paid down
//! rather than argued away: the boot warning and `/readyz`'s 503 both name this
//! command, and `doctor` reports the missing ceiling as MISSING with the command
//! to run. An operator who forgets is told, three times, in the three places
//! they are already looking.
//!
//! What a route would add, if one is ever wanted: a hosted control plane where
//! the *vendor* — not a tenant — widens the ceiling for a customer without shell
//! access to the box. Build it when there is a platform principal to
//! authenticate, and build it on `store::policy::install_ceiling`, which is
//! where the interesting half already lives.
//!
//! # The tenant, role and employee layers: also a subcommand, but not for the reason above
//!
//! The escalation argument does not carry down here, and pretending it does
//! would be dishonest. A tenant layer belongs *to a tenant*, and a tenant is
//! exactly what an API key proves: `auth::require_api_key` yields a `Principal`,
//! `Db::tenant_tx` pins the transaction, `0006_policy.sql`'s WITH CHECK pins the
//! row. A route under `/v1/policy/…` would write only rows the caller already
//! owns. Nor would it be a new *class* of authority: the same key already hires
//! employees through `POST /v1/org`, hands a team a daily budget through
//! `PUT /v1/teams/{id}/budget` and hands a seat its spend caps — and a budget is
//! a thing that moves money, which a policy layer on its own is not. And it
//! could not widen: every layer it wrote would still be an argument to
//! `EffectivePolicy::try_new`, which takes the minimum of every cap and the
//! intersection of every allowlist, under a ceiling no key can reach.
//!
//! So a route is *defensible* here. It is still not what this builds, for two
//! reasons that are about this repository rather than about authorisation.
//!
//! **One place to write a limit.** `routes/teams.rs` argues it at length and
//! `docs/TEAMS.md` §2 repeats it: a team's endpoint moves a *pointer* at a
//! `role_name` and never a cap, "because two places to write a limit is one
//! place to forget to tighten". That sentence is load-bearing — it is why
//! `POST /v1/org` can take a 500-row document from one call without being a
//! second gate. Adding `PUT /v1/policy/role/{name}` would make it false on the
//! same surface, and the module that argues hardest against it is the one an
//! operator reads next.
//!
//! **The premise the route would rest on is one variable wide.** "The key is the
//! operator" held because `AGENTOS_API_KEYS` was a static, operator-written
//! keyring: there was no route that minted a key, so no employee held one. The
//! day one does — a self-service console, a per-seat token — a route here
//! becomes an employee that can rewrite its own employee layer up to its
//! tenant's, which is every grant its colleagues have. A subcommand keeps
//! working through that change without anybody noticing it had to.
//!
//! *That day half-arrived with `0044_api_keys`, and the premise survives on a
//! narrower reason.* There is now a route that mints a key — but it is
//! `POST /v1/platform/keys`, it is authorised by a principal that is not a
//! tenant, and what it mints is a **tenant** credential with exactly the
//! authority `AGENTOS_API_KEYS` always granted. No employee holds one, because
//! nothing an employee can reach can issue one: a tenant's own key presented to
//! that route is a 401, which is the property `routes::platform` exists to keep.
//! The premise fails the day a key is minted *per seat*, and the sentence above
//! is still the reason not to.
//!
//! What the route would buy, concretely, is a tenant who is *not* the operator:
//! somebody who holds an API key and no shell. This deployment has no such
//! person — the runbook's operator exports `DATABASE_URL` and `KEY` in the same
//! terminal — so the route would be a second door to a room with one occupant.
//! Build it the day the tenant and the operator are two people, build it on
//! `store::policy::install_layer` (which is already tenant-scoped, runs under
//! RLS and refuses a tenant it cannot see), and give another tenant's id the
//! repository's 404 rather than a 403, for the reason `routes/teams.rs` gives.
//!
//! # Both arguments survived, and it turned out they were about *replacing*
//!
//! `routes::companies` writes role layers over HTTP. That is not this module
//! changing its mind; it is the two objections above being read more carefully
//! than they were written, because both of them are objections to a **`PUT`**.
//!
//! An absent layer inherits the layer above (`store::policy::load` substitutes
//! rather than defaulting), so the effective policy before an install is
//! `above ∧ above` and after it is `above ∧ new`, and
//! `EffectivePolicy::try_new` takes the minimum of every cap and the
//! intersection of every allowlist. **Writing a layer where none existed is
//! contained in what was already permitted, field by field** — it cannot widen
//! even the *stored* row, let alone the ruling. Replacing one has no such
//! property: the incoming layer is not intersected with the one it displaces,
//! so `PUT /v1/policy/role/{name}` really is a way to raise a cap over HTTP and
//! this module was right to refuse it.
//!
//! So `POST /v1/companies` may create a role layer and answers
//! `409 role_layer_exists` for one that is already there and says something
//! else. Both sentences above stay true on that line:
//!
//! * **"Two places to write a limit is one place to forget to tighten."** There
//!   is still one place to *change* a limit, and it is this command. A route
//!   that can only ever narrow-from-inheritance is not a second place to forget,
//!   because there is nothing there yet to forget to tighten.
//! * **"The premise is one variable wide."** The day something mints a per-seat
//!   token, that token finds every role layer of a live company already written
//!   and gets a `409`. It cannot rewrite its own limits up to its tenant's,
//!   which is the escalation this module names — and it never could, since the
//!   *employee* scope has no door at all.
//!
//! What is still only here: the platform ceiling (whose row belongs to no tenant
//! and binds every other one — there is a platform principal now, and the two
//! bullets at the top of this module are why the ceiling did not follow the
//! keyring onto it), and every *edit* to a layer that exists. [`rollback_layer`]
//! too:
//! a rollback removes a layer, and removing one is the one operation in this
//! file that genuinely widens.
