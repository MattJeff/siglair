//! The A2A surface: one agent card at the well-known path, one JSON-RPC
//! binding, and the Policy Gate between a stranger's agent and ours.
//!
//! # Why the card is mounted at the root
//!
//! `/.well-known/agent-card.json` **is** the discovery mechanism. A peer that
//! knows our host and nothing else fetches exactly that path; a card nested
//! under `/v1/` or `/a2a/` is a card nobody finds, and the deployment then
//! "works" right up until a real peer tries to talk to it. So the route is
//! mounted at the root, spelled out here rather than composed from a prefix,
//! because a prefix is a thing somebody adds later.
//!
//! # v1.0 facts this file depends on
//!
//! * The card declares exactly **one** entry in `supportedInterfaces[]`
//!   (JSON-RPC) and carries no top-level `url`, `preferredTransport` or
//!   `protocolVersion` — v1.0 removed all three. `agentos_app::a2a::agent_card`
//!   is the single constructor, so the shape cannot drift between this route
//!   and the rest of the system.
//! * Method names are PascalCase: `SendMessage`, `GetTask`, `ListTasks`,
//!   `CancelTask`, `SubscribeToTask`. There is no `Update`.
//! * `A2A-Version` absent means 0.3 (the version before the header was
//!   mandatory); a version we cannot serve is JSON-RPC `-32009` and the call
//!   never runs. Both rules come from `agentos_app::a2a::negotiate_version`,
//!   which is the same function the SDK interceptor calls — one rule, one
//!   implementation.
//! * The card ships **unsigned**. See `agentos_app::a2a` for why.
//!
//! # Two routers, because they are authenticated differently
//!
//! [`card_router`] is mounted at the root and **outside** the API-key layer:
//! discovery is what a peer does *before* it has anything, and a card behind a
//! credential is a card nobody can fetch. The card is public information by
//! construction — it is the document whose whole purpose is to be published —
//! so it carries the employee's handle, address and capabilities and nothing
//! else. [`router`] is the JSON-RPC binding and is mounted **inside** the API
//! stack, because the peer's identity *is* the key's label.
//!
//! That split is why [`card`] takes no [`Principal`] and resolves the employee
//! itself. The lookup is deployment-wide rather than tenant-scoped for the same
//! reason: there is no credential to name a tenant with. See [`discover`].
//!
//! # Who the peer is
//!
//! From the credential, never from the body. The API key's label is the peer's
//! domain, exactly mirroring `agentos_app::a2a::peer_of`, which reads it off the
//! authenticated SDK identity. A peer that gets to name itself in `params` is
//! not an allowlist, it is a suggestion box.
//!
//! # What a call may do
//!
//! Accept and persist. Nothing else. Every call is authorized as an
//! [`Action::A2aSend`] against the peer allowlist before it touches a row, and
//! the message body becomes [`Untrusted<String>`] at the edge and is never
//! unwrapped in this file — it is stored through serde, which is transparent
//! for the wrapper, and handed to the turn runner by the inbound loop later.
//! That is why the payment test below passes by construction: this module holds
//! no `Authorized<A>` for anything but `A2aSend`, and `Effects` is unreachable
//! without one.
//!
//! ponytail: the SDK types (`A2aExecutor`, `GateInterceptor`, `PgTaskStore`)
//! cannot be *called* from this crate — `a2a-server-lf` is not a dependency of
//! `agentos-server`, so `CallContext` and `A2AError` cannot be named, and the
//! executor's methods take both. So the binding is written against JSON and the
//! task document, which `crates/store/src/a2a.rs` treats as opaque jsonb and
//! `crates/app/src/a2a.rs` maps to `a2a::Task`. Every field spelling below —
//! `contextId`, `TASK_STATE_SUBMITTED`, `ROLE_USER`, `{"text": …}` — is that
//! mapping's wire form, so a task written here parses as an `a2a::Task` there.
//! Adding `a2a-lf`/`a2a-server-lf` to this crate's manifest replaces
//! `send_message`/`get_task`/`list_tasks` with three calls into `A2aExecutor`,
//! and this comment with a `use`.
