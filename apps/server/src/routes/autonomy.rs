//! `GET /v1/autonomy`: how much of the work the agents actually did.
//!
//! # Why this endpoint exists
//!
//! The claim this project will eventually have to defend is *"the agents did
//! the work"*, and the first question anybody asks is *"how much did you do
//! yourself?"*. Every action already writes an audit row and every approval
//! writes another, so the evidence was there; nothing aggregated it, so the
//! honest answer was "we don't know". This is the answer, per tenant and per
//! employee, over a window an operator chooses.
//!
//! # The principle, before the numbers
//!
//! **When an event can be read as autonomous or as assisted, it is counted as
//! assisted.** This number will be quoted in public. Every definition below is
//! the one that makes it *smaller*: the percentage truncates rather than
//! rounds, a `system` actor counts against autonomy, and an operator who drove
//! an action through the API counts as an intervention even though the trail
//! cannot say whether they were rescuing the agent or just using the API.
//!
//! A future edit that loosens one of these is loosening a claim, not fixing a
//! bug. Say so in the commit message.
//!
//! # The taxonomy
//!
//! Four kinds of human involvement, kept apart because averaging them together
//! produces a number that flatters whichever is cheapest:
//!
//! | kind | what the row looks like | in the ratio? |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **approved** | `decision = 'allow'` with an `approval_id` in the payload — only `PolicyGate::redeem_approval` writes that | intervention |
//! | **rejected** | `action_kind = 'approval_decided'`, `payload.outcome = 'denied'` — only [`super::approvals::deny`] writes that | intervention |
//! | **configuring** | `action_kind = 'policy_changed'` | **neither** — setup is not intervention |
//! | **acting in the agent's place** | `decision = 'allow'`, operator actor, no approval spent | intervention |
//!
//! Autonomy is one bucket and one only: `decision = 'allow'`, an *employee*
//! actor, no approval spent.
//!
//! ```text
//! decisions    = actions_taken + human_rejected
//! autonomy_pct = 100 * actions_unassisted / decisions
//! ```
//!
//! A rejection produced no action, so it is not in `actions_taken` — but it is
//! in the denominator, because a human spent attention on it. Configuration is
//! in neither term: letting it inflate `actions_taken` would be the single
//! easiest way to flatter this figure, so it has its own column and no path
//! into the arithmetic. A policy *denial* is not an intervention either — the
//! human who wrote the policy is already counted under configuration, and
//! charging them twice for one act would understate autonomy for a reason that
//! is not true.
//!
//! The full derivation, and the reason each `filter` clause is spelled the way
//! it is, lives in `migrations/0022_autonomy.sql` next to the SQL.
//!
//! # What the audit trail cannot distinguish today
//!
//! Read this before quoting the number anywhere. In full in the migration; the
//! four that change how the figure should be read:
//!
//! * **Operator-initiated is not the same as operator-as-fallback.** Nothing in
//!   the trail says whether a human drove an action *because the agent could
//!   not*. Both are counted as interventions — the strict reading, which
//!   overstates intervention rather than autonomy.
//! * **"Who" is a credential, not a person.** `AuditActor::Operator` holds the
//!   API key's label ([`crate::auth`]). Two humans on one key are one actor.
//! * **Most configuration leaves no audit row at all.** Only `routes::teams`
//!   and `routes::mcp` write `policy_changed`; charters, cadences, psyches and
//!   employee creation write nothing. `configuration_changes` is a floor, not a
//!   count, so the setup behind an autonomous-looking employee is largely
//!   invisible.
//! * **Rulings, not outcomes.** One row per `authorize` call, so an agent that
//!   retries the same email three times books three actions — a chatty agent
//!   scores higher than a careful one. And an authorised action is not a
//!   completed one.
//!
//! # Cost is not here, on purpose
//!
//! There is no revenue-over-cost figure and no `cost_minor`, and only one of
//! the two reasons for that is still true. The tokens themselves are recorded:
//! `model_usage_daily` (`0024_model_usage.sql`) carries input, output and
//! cache-read counts per employee per day, `model_usage::record` writes it
//! wherever a turn finishes, and `routes::usage` serves it. What is missing is
//! the other half — **there is no price list in this codebase**, so a euro
//! figure would rest on a number nobody could trace, and a cost figure nobody
//! can trace is worse than a missing one. A price table with a source is the
//! one thing that has to land.
//!
//! # The aggregate cannot be written by hand
//!
//! `employee_autonomy_daily` is a VIEW over `audit_log`, following
//! `supplier_reputation` in `0007_sourcing.sql` and for the same reason: a
//! score nobody can write is a score nobody can inflate. It aggregates, so
//! Postgres refuses a write to it under any privilege, and `app_role` holds
//! SELECT and nothing else. There is no recompute job to go stale.
//!
//! # The tenant
//!
//! From [`Principal`], i.e. from the API key. The view is `security_invoker`
//! over an RLS'd `audit_log`, so there is no `WHERE tenant_id` here for anyone
//! to forget and another tenant's autonomy is not merely unlisted — it is
//! invisible.
