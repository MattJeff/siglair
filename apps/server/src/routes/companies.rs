//! `POST /v1/companies` — a whole company, standing, from one call.
//!
//! `docs/ORIZN.md` is nine steps and step 5 carries the sentence **"this part is
//! not an HTTP call"**. That sentence is the reason nothing downstream of it has
//! a client: a product whose entry journey is *name the project, connect the
//! server, describe what it does, then pick tools, employees, models, budget* is
//! a product that cannot ship an entry journey while its third step is a shell
//! on the database box. This module is that step, and the four either side of
//! it, behind one request.
//!
//! # Why one call and not four
//!
//! [`routes::teams::apply_org`](super::teams::apply_org) already argues it for
//! its own document and the argument transfers whole: the seven-row table was
//! twenty calls with no transaction across them, and the failure was not "the
//! call failed" but *a company half-built in a way an operator can neither read
//! nor safely retry*. A company is that failure one level up. Four calls —
//! tenant, layers, chart, budgets — have four places to stop, and three of the
//! four resulting states are worse than nothing:
//!
//! | died after | what is standing |
//! |---|---|
//! | the tenant | a tenant with no employees. Harmless. |
//! | the layers | limits and nobody to bind. **Harmless — and this is why they go first.** |
//! | the chart | employees. On whatever limits happen to exist, for however long nobody said. |
//!
//! The third row is the one that matters and it is the whole reason for the
//! order below. **The layers are written before the chart, always.** An absent
//! role layer inherits the layer above it (`store::policy::load`), so a company
//! that got its org chart and not its limits is a company whose every seat runs
//! on the platform ceiling — the widest thing in the deployment — with nothing
//! anywhere reporting that it happened. Reverse the two and the same crash
//! leaves rows that grant nobody anything, because there is no *body* yet.
//!
//! The operating window is the same sentence about time rather than authority —
//! an absent `company_windows` row means *runs forever*
//! (`migrations/0054_operating_window.sql`), so a chart standing without one is
//! seats nobody has told to stop, spending the customer's own model budget. It
//! does not need the ordering argument, because it does better: the window and
//! the chart are written in **one** transaction, so that row cannot exist.
//!
//! # What is atomic, and what is deliberately not
//!
//! **Atomic:** the tenant row and its first `policy_versions` row
//! (`store::policy::create_tenant`, one transaction, and the pair is an
//! invariant — a tenant with no active version has *invisible* layers). Each
//! role layer, individually: one new version, the previous one intact behind it.
//! The operating window, the whole org chart and this route's own audit rows, in
//! one `TenantTx`.
//!
//! **Not atomic:** the call. There are `2 + roles` commit points and no
//! transaction spans them, because [`agentos_store::policy::install_layer`]
//! mints one version per layer by design and folding five layers into one
//! version would delete `policy rollback --tenant`'s meaning — "undo the
//! customer-success change" is a per-layer sentence. `docs/ORIZN.md` §5 already
//! made this trade for the shell loop and made it for the failure that actually
//! happens: **a re-run repairs rather than duplicating.**
//!
//! So the guarantee is not atomicity, it is *convergence*, and it is bought with
//! keys the caller chose rather than with a header:
//!
//! * the tenant is `Principal::tenant_id` — never a body field, so there is no
//!   uuid a caller can name and re-running cannot address a second tenant;
//! * a role layer is its `role_name`, and an identical one is
//!   [`Installed::Unchanged`](agentos_store::policy::Installed::Unchanged) —
//!   no row, no version;
//! * a team is its slug and an employee is its slug, which is `apply_org`'s own
//!   idempotence and the reason neither endpoint wants an `Idempotency-Key`;
//! * the window is the tenant's one row, and a replay carrying the same instant
//!   writes neither the row nor an audit line — a company gets its window once,
//!   from whichever run got there first, and a body naming a *different* instant
//!   is refused rather than quietly extending it.
//!
//! An `Idempotency-Key` is still honoured if a client sends one — the layer in
//! `main.rs` replays the recorded response without reaching this handler at all
//! — but nothing here depends on that, which is the point.
//!
//! Replay any prefix and the second run finishes it. That is asserted, from a
//! call cut in the middle, by `apps/server/tests/orizn.rs`.
//!
//! # What is not in this call, and will not be
//!
//! **The ceiling.** It is the most dangerous document in the system and it is
//! the one thing here that belongs to *no tenant* — `tenant_id IS NULL`, which
//! `0006_policy.sql`'s WITH CHECK makes unwritable from any tenant transaction.
//! A route that installed one would open an admin transaction on the strength of
//! a credential meaning "I am tenant X" and write a row binding every *other*
//! tenant: `apps::server::policy` calls that a privilege escalation with a JSON
//! body and it is right. There is no `ceiling` field, and `deny_unknown_fields`
//! means a caller who sends one is told so rather than ignored.
//!
//! **And it does not fall back to [`policy::default_ceiling`].** That function
//! exists and is deliberately chosen to be defensible *as a policy* — but it is
//! 200 turns a day, 50 new contacts a day and a $100 band nobody looks at, and
//! Orizn's runbook ceiling is 30, 20 and **$1**. A route that installed the
//! default when none was present would hand every company created through it a
//! ceiling six times wider than the one the runbook argues for, silently, as the
//! consequence of a field somebody left out. That is precisely the shape of
//! failure the layer-completeness rule exists to refuse, one level up. So: **no
//! ceiling is a refusal**, `409 no_platform_policy`, naming the command — the
//! same answer `/readyz` and the boot warning already give, on the surface an
//! operator is now looking at.
//!
//! **A limit, after the first one.** See [`create_company`]: this route may
//! *create* a role layer and may never *replace* one.
//!
//! # What it may not do that `routes::teams` may not do either
//!
//! No spend row. `PUT /v1/teams/{id}/budget` and `PUT /v1/employees/{id}/spend-caps`
//! stay separate calls and step 6 of the runbook stays two lines, because a
//! budget is the thing that moves money and `org::reserve` reads the *absence*
//! of one as "may not spend". A company that stands up unable to pay anybody is
//! the correct company to stand up.

///
/// **The arithmetic underneath, which is why creating is safe and replacing is

/// the most expensive defect this product can have, and it would arrive as the
/// silent consequence of an omitted field — which is, word for word, the failure
/// the missing-ceiling refusal above exists to prevent and the failure the
/// empty-seat rule exists to prevent. Three omissions, one answer: **the
/// expensive default is a refusal, named, before a row is written.**
///
/// *A default duration* is the same thing with a label on it, and it is worse
/// here because the number would be a price: too short and a paying company
/// stops in the night, too long and the runaway is merely slower. 0054 refused
/// to pick it in SQL and `PUT /v1/window` refused to pick it in Rust; this
/// refuses for the third time rather than being the one place it leaked in.
///
/// **What it costs, honestly.** Every caller of this route has to send a date, so
/// this is a breaking change to a body — one call site in this workspace and one
/// block in `docs/ORIZN.md`. It is not retroactive: a company that already
/// exists has no `company_windows` row, `halt::window` answers `None`, and
/// `halt::halted` answers `None` with it, so nothing that is running stops
/// because a field became required. Those companies keep running forever until
/// somebody calls `PUT /v1/window`, and no code here invents a date for them —
/// see the note at the end of this comment.
///
/// **And it may create a window, never replace one**, which is the role-layer
/// rule again and rests on the same arithmetic. No window at all means *runs
/// forever*, so writing the first one can only ever close; replacing one with a
/// later instant extends it, which widens. A body naming a different instant
/// than the row already there is `409 window_exists`, naming `PUT /v1/window`,
/// which is the verb that extends and leaves a `company_halt_changed` row saying
/// who did. An identical instant writes nothing at all — that is what makes a
/// replay a repair here, exactly as `Installed::Unchanged` does for a layer.
///
/// The refusal is on **difference and not on direction**, and an *earlier*
/// instant is refused too even though shortening a window provably cannot widen
/// anything. The rule could have been "later is a conflict, sooner is fine", and
/// it is not, because the caller of this route is a provisioning script being
/// re-run: a company that has been standing for a week should not have its clock

/// # Why a route may create this at all
///
/// `store::policy::create_tenant` argues that tenant creation "has no principal
/// but the operator", and that is true of the *command*, which takes a uuid from
/// a shell. It is not true here and the difference is the whole justification:
/// the id is [`Principal::tenant_id`], which came out of `AGENTOS_API_KEYS` —
/// a static keyring the operator wrote before the process booted, with no route
/// anywhere that mints an entry. **There is no uuid a caller can name.** A key
/// for tenant X can bring exactly tenant X into existence, and a key for a
/// tenant that already exists brings nothing.
///
/// So this is not the escalation `apps/server/src/policy.rs` refuses. That one
/// is about the *platform* layer, whose row belongs to no tenant and binds every
/// other one. This row belongs to the caller and binds nobody else.
///
/// What it buys is a defect `docs/ORIZN.md` already lists under "what this
/// document knows it does not do": skip the tenant row and `POST /v1/org`
/// answers **`500 internal`** with an opaque body, and the cause is a foreign
/// key in the server log. The document's suggested fix is a pre-flight that
/// answers 400 instead. Creating the row is strictly better than a 400 and it is
/// the same act the operator would have performed.
///
/// # It adopts and it does not rename
///
/// An existing tenant is used as it stands. Renaming somebody's company as a
/// side effect of a replay is the kind of surprise `apply_org` refuses for
/// deleted rows and it is refused here — but a **mismatch is not ignored**
/// either: a body that says it is building "acme" against a tenant that is
/// "orizn" is almost always the wrong API key in the terminal, and silently
/// building Acme's org chart inside Orizn is not recoverable by re-running
/// anything. `409 tenant_mismatch`, before a single row is written.
///
/// The insert races with itself — two replays in flight both read no row — and
/// the loser gets a unique violation, which is read as "somebody else created
/// it" and falls through to the same success. That is what convergence means
/// when there is no lock to take.
