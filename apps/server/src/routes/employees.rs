//! `/v1/employees`: create, read, list, suspend, terminate.
//!
//! # Creation is an acceptance, not a provisioning run
//!
//! The previous design called eleven external APIs *inside* the HTTP handler.
//! A client waited forty seconds holding a connection, a pool slot and a
//! transaction; a timeout anywhere in the middle left a half-built employee
//! that nobody was driving, and a retry started the whole thing again from
//! zero — buying a second phone number on the way.
//!
//! So [`create`] writes three things in one transaction — the employee row, its
//! eleven `pending` resource rows, and one outbox event — and answers **202
//! Accepted**. Nothing external is touched. The provisioning loop picks the
//! event up and converges the employee, at its own pace, with its own leases
//! and its own crash-safety. The client gets its id in single-digit
//! milliseconds and can watch the steps land through [`get`].
//!
//! `Idempotency-Key` is **required** here, and that is the difference between
//! "accepted" being safe and being a duplicate-employee generator: without a
//! key, a client that retries a request whose response it never saw creates a
//! second employee with a second set of resources. The layer in `main.rs` does
//! the replaying; this module only insists that the header is there, because
//! the layer treats a missing key as "the caller does not want idempotency" —
//! a reasonable default for the API as a whole, and the wrong one for the one
//! endpoint that mints billable resources.
//!
//! # Reads say what is actually true
//!
//! [`get`] renders every resource's real state, including
//! [`ResourceState::PendingExternal`] with its `poll_ref` and `expected_by`. A
//! step waiting on a Twilio regulatory bundle or a WhatsApp sender review
//! renders as exactly that, never as a green check — the whole point of the
//! state existing. `health` is [`Employee::health`], derived from the eleven
//! rows on every read; the `employees.health` column is never read back,
//! because a worker that finishes a step does not update it and it therefore
//! goes stale within seconds of being written.
//!
//! # The tenant
//!
//! Every handler takes its tenant from [`Principal`], i.e. from the API key,
//! and opens a `tenant_tx` with it. Nothing reads a tenant from a body or a
//! path. An id belonging to another tenant is invisible to RLS, surfaces as
//! [`StoreError::NotFound`], and is answered **404** — not 403, which would
//! confirm the id exists.
