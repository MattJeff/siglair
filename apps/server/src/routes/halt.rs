//! `/v1/halt`: stop the whole company, and let it go again. `/v1/window`: say
//! in advance when it stops by itself.
//!
//! **The two are one feature.** An operating window that has run out is a halt
//! — `agentos_store::halt::halted` reports it as one — so everything the next
//! seventy lines promise about a halt is promised about a window that ended,
//! by the same code, with nothing added. What differs is the sentence a founder
//! reads back and the verb that ends it: a halt is released, a window is
//! extended. `migrations/0054_operating_window.sql` argues why that is one
//! mechanism rather than two, and the short version is that "everywhere a stop
//! is respected" is a list of five call sites in three crates that has already
//! been out of date once.
//!
//! **The call this exists for is somebody saying "stop everything, now".**
//! Before this file the answer was a loop over `POST /v1/employees/{id}/suspend`
//! in an order nobody had chosen, which is not an answer: the first seat
//! suspended can still be woken by the last one that has not been, an approval
//! filed this morning is still clickable, and a turn already inside a model call
//! is still going to spend its twenty tool calls on the way out.
//!
//! # What a customer is promised, exactly
//!
//! Three sentences, and the third one is a refusal to lie:
//!
//! 1. **No new turn starts.** `agentos_app::model_access::connected` reads the
//!    halt before a turn is reserved, so a stopped company thinks about nothing
//!    and is billed for nothing. Its outbox rows are not claimed at all
//!    (`agentos_store::outbox::claim_except`), so nothing waiting is lost and
//!    nothing burns an attempt.
//! 2. **No effect reaches the world.** `agentos_app::gate::PolicyGate` reads the
//!    halt before it reads any policy, and every effect in the workspace needs a
//!    token only that gate can mint. There is no second door.
//! 3. **What is already in flight is not recalled, and cannot be.** A message
//!    handed to Resend is gone; there is no API for un-sending it and this
//!    product will not pretend otherwise. What is bounded is how long that
//!    window is: at most one already-dispatched provider call per employee, and
//!    the provider clients time out at sixty seconds
//!    (`crates/providers/src/email_resend.rs`, `telephony_twilio.rs`,
//!    `browser_browserbase.rs`). A turn already inside a model call keeps
//!    thinking until its own 120-second deadline and then stops, having been
//!    refused at every tool call it tried on the way.
//!
//! So: **nothing new after the commit; sixty seconds of tail.** That is the
//! number to say out loud, and it is a ceiling rather than a measurement.
//!
//! # It stops receiving too, and this paragraph used to say otherwise
//!
//! It said: *the inbound loop keeps fetching mail and landing it in `messages`,
//! and the turns it queues wait in the outbox until the release.* **That has not
//! been true since the halt moved onto the `tenants` driver.** A stopped tenant
//! offers no seat, so `agentos_store::outbox::claim_of` returns none of its
//! rows — and receiving is two claims off that one function, so the stop lands
//! twice:
//!
//! 1. the **raw delivery** the edge stored (`routes::webhooks::RAW_AGGREGATE`),
//!    which the general poller would turn into a notice;
//! 2. the **notice** (`agentos_app::inbound::NOTICE_AGGREGATE`), which the
//!    inbound loop would turn into a `messages` row.
//!
//! `loops::inbound`'s `a_stop_defers_receiving_at_both_gates_and_the_release_drains_it`
//! asserts all of it against a database, including that fixing only the second
//! gate would change nothing: no notice is ever written while the first is
//! deferred.
//!
//! **The argument the old paragraph made is still right, and it is why this one
//! exists rather than a deletion.** Losing a stopped company's customer email
//! would be worse than the thing the halt is for, and reading is not acting —
//! the same asymmetry `agentos_app::effects::Effects::opted_out` is argued from.
//! What was wrong was the tense: that is what *should* happen, and it is not
//! what the code does.
//!
//! ## What is actually at risk, which is less than it sounds and not nothing
//!
//! Nothing is lost on our side and no attempt is burned. `POST /v1/webhooks/…`
//! is a route, not a claim, so the delivery is durable in `outbox_events` the
//! moment the signature checks out, halt or no halt; both rows then wait at
//! `attempt_count = 0` and the release makes them due at once. A halt cannot
//! dead-letter mail.
//!
//! What waits **at the provider** is the part that was never ours. The webhook
//! carries an envelope — message id, from, to — and
//! `agentos_app::inbound::ingest_email` fetches the body and the attachment
//! bytes afterwards, in phase two. So the exposure of a halt is exactly the
//! provider's retention:
//!
//! * **Attachments: one hour, known.** `download_url` dies an hour after it is
//!   minted, and `ingest_email` already lands the message without them and logs
//!   a warning. Any halt longer than an hour loses a stopped company's
//!   attachments, today, silently apart from that line.
//! * **Bodies: unknown, and not knowable from this binary.**
//!
//! ## FOUNDER'S QUESTION, LEFT OPEN
//!
//! **How long does Resend keep an inbound message we have not fetched?** That
//! number is the whole decision and nothing in this process can read it:
//!
//! * If it is comfortably longer than a halt ever lasts, this paragraph is the
//!   end of it — the deferral is harmless and the halt is simpler for covering
//!   everything.
//! * If it is short, the code has to hold the old promise, and the shape of
//!   that fix is known and is **not** a one-line one. Both claims come off
//!   `claim_of`, whose halt clause is deliberately on the tenant driver rather
//!   than on the rows ("same refusal, one join earlier"), and the general
//!   poller's partition mixes rows that must keep waiting (`conversation`
//!   turns, `employee.terminated`) with the `webhook` rows that must not. So it
//!   means teaching the hottest statement in the system which aggregate types a
//!   stop does not stop, *inside* the per-tenant `LIMIT` — outside it, a
//!   tenant's backlog of deferred turns starves the exempt rows behind it — and
//!   re-measuring the plan that `claim_of` documents.
//!
//! Do not half-do it. Exempting the notice claim alone is a change with no
//! effect at all, and it would read like a fix.
//!
//! # What a halt deliberately does not stop
//!
//! **Finishing a convergence that had already started.**
//! `apps/server/src/loops/provisioning.rs` converges an employee somebody
//! already asked for towards mailboxes and phone numbers, with no policy gate
//! anywhere on its path. This paragraph used to say the whole loop was
//! uncovered, on the grounds that half-covering it is worse than not:
//! interrupting a convergence leaves resources bought and unbound, which is what
//! `GET /v1/inventory/stranded` exists to find, and stopping it properly means a
//! resumable state machine that knows how to be paused.
//!
//! That argument is sound and it only ever covered half the ground. *Not
//! starting* a convergence is not *interrupting* one, and it strands nothing,
//! because there is nothing yet to strand. So the loop's claim now skips a
//! stopped company's rows that have not begun — `pending`, `failed`, and a
//! `pending_external` wait nothing on our side can move — and still claims the
//! one row that has: a `provisioning` row whose lease lapsed is a provider call
//! whose outcome nobody knows, and the only reconciler of one is inside
//! `converge`. `CLAIM_SQL`'s doc comment carries the table.
//!
//! What moved this over the line is that the ceiling of the old argument was
//! crossed without anybody touching it: it was written when a halt was rare,
//! short, and placed by a human who was coming back to lift it. Since
//! `migrations/0054_operating_window.sql` a company stops **by itself, on a
//! date, and may stay stopped for weeks**. "We buy anyway during a halt" was an
//! hour's tolerance; it had become a recurring invoice.
//!
//! Still uncovered, and named rather than implied: an employee exempted for its
//! one lapsed lease has all eleven of its steps converged, pending ones
//! included, because `converge` takes an employee and not a step list. That last
//! gap *is* the resumable state machine, and it is still not this unit.
//!
//! # Who may throw it
//!
//! A human, and the audit row names them. That is not enforced by a role check
//! here — it is enforced by there being nothing for an employee to reach it
//! with. No `Action` variant rules on a halt, so `PolicyGate` cannot mint a
//! token for one; `Effects` exposes no method; `agentos_store::halt` has two
//! readers — `agentos_app::gate::PolicyGate` and
//! `agentos_app::model_access::connected`, both on `halt::halted` — and two
//! writers, and both writers are operator routes in this binary: this file, and
//! `routes::companies::create_company`, which may write a company's **first**
//! window through `halt::set_window` and answers `409 window_exists` rather than
//! replacing one. (That second writer is why this sentence used to say "this one
//! writer" and stopped being true: `POST /v1/companies` gives a company its
//! clock, and a clock is a halt with a date on it.) Every HTTP caller is an
//! operator API key (`crate::auth`), never a seat. A tenant cannot halt another
//! tenant because the write goes through `tenant_tx` and `company_halts` has RLS
//! forced with `with check` — Postgres refuses it, not a handler.
//!
//! # Why the release is not a widening
//!
//! It deletes one row. No `policy_layers` row is written by either verb, so the
//! effective policy after a release is the same four rows it was before the
//! halt — there is no saved copy to restore wrong and no path by which coming
//! back up grants anything that was not already granted. That property is why
//! the halt is its own table rather than an empty tenant policy layer, and
//! `migrations/0045_company_halt.sql` argues it in full.
