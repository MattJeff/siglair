//! `/v1/invoices`: the founder's half of the register — read what is owed, and
//! say when it arrived.
//!
//! `migrations/0066_invoices.sql` argues for the table and
//! [`agentos_store::invoices`] is the SQL. This is the only surface that reads
//! either, and the only one that writes `paid_at`.
//!
//! # There is no `POST /v1/invoices`, and that is the design
//!
//! `routes::work` and `routes::calendar` both let an operator create the thing
//! their internal tool is about, because a work item and an appointment are
//! things a founder writes down. An invoice is not: **the only way one exists is
//! `Effects::issue_invoice`, holding a token the Policy Gate minted for an
//! employee.** So issuing leaves a `provider_call_attempted` row linked to the
//! ruling that permitted it, every time, with no second path that does not.
//!
//! An operator route here would be that second path — a demand for money with no
//! decision behind it, indistinguishable in the table from one an employee was
//! authorised to make. `work_items` accepted exactly that ambiguity and paid for
//! it with `0064`'s `posted_by` column; this table declines it up front.
//!
//! `invoices.issued_by` stopped being NOT NULL in
//! `migrations/0071_an_invoice_needs_a_number.sql` and this paragraph did not
//! weaken: the null is not "an operator issued this", it is "this row is a
//! credit note", which `invoices_issuer_or_correction` makes the *same* fact
//! rather than a second one. Issuing is still an employee's only.
//!
//! The cost is real and is the founder's to switch on: until the `issue_invoice`
//! tool row lands in `agentos_app::turn::catalogue` — written out there
//! verbatim, unapplied, because it moves two pinned digests — no employee can
//! reach the effect from a turn, so the register fills only from Rust. The
//! endpoint that would paper over that is the one this module refuses to be.
//!
//! # Why `paid` is an operator's and never an employee's
//!
//! Nothing in this process can call a bank or a PSP, so "it was paid" is not
//! observed here, it is asserted. The seat that issued an invoice must not be
//! the thing that records the money arriving — an employee that could settle its
//! own receivables has a clean ledger and no revenue — so the assertion comes
//! from the same authority that writes charters and cadences: an API key, not a
//! principal the gate rules on.
//!
//! That is also why there is no `ActionKind::InvoicePaid`. The Stripe webhook
//! writes `paid_at` now (`agentos_app::stripe`), and the writer is still not an
//! employee.
//!
//! # No `paid_by`, and an audit row after all
//!
//! No column: `routes::work`'s reason before `0064` holds for the column, since
//! every writer of `paid_at` holds an operator key or is the webhook. The audit
//! row is the thing this module used to refuse and now writes, because the
//! argument for refusing it stopped being true the day Stripe wrote one:
//! `AuditKind::InvoicePaid` exists, the Stripe path files it with the event id,
//! and a register with two ways to be settled and a trail that shows only one
//! of them answers "who said this was paid" with a shrug for exactly the
//! settlements a person asserted by hand. So `paid` writes the same kind, with
//! the key's principal as actor and `"source": "operator"` in the payload
//! where Stripe's says `"stripe"` — and only on the call that settled, so a
//! replay that `declare_paid` reports as `false` leaves no second row.
