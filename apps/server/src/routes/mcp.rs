//! `/v1/mcp`: the operator half of MCP — declaring a server, and the one path
//! by which a declaration becomes a live binding.
//!
//! [`agentos_app::mcp`] has been a complete MCP client for a while: an SSRF
//! check at bind time, one round trip per call, risk classes that only an
//! operator may lower, and a SHA-256 pin on the exact tool a human read. None of
//! it ran, because nothing ever created a binding. `mcp_servers` and
//! `mcp_tool_declarations` existed and could only be written with psql. This
//! module is the door, and the things it has to get right are below.
//!
//! # 0. Every connector is a bound MCP server, and the two that were missing
//!
//! The onboarding step this module serves is one sentence: *the customer arrives
//! with a SaaS, names the tools their company already uses, clicks each one, and
//! it connects.* GitHub, Trello, Discord, Smartlead, their own box — the claim is
//! that all of them are the same thing, an MCP server, and that everything
//! underneath is already built and already guarded.
//!
//! That claim held. What was missing was not a subsystem, it was two things:
//!
//! * **A credential.** Every remote MCP server worth connecting authenticates,
//!   and `McpServer::bind` used `StreamableHttpClientTransport::from_uri`, which
//!   sets `auth_header: None` in so many words. So the whole client could bind
//!   exactly one class of server: the ones that need nothing. `0040_mcp_credentials`
//!   is the column and [`agentos_app::mcp::Credentials`] is the path — a token
//!   taken once, sealed, and never returned by any signature in either crate.
//! * **A catalogue.** [`agentos_app::catalog`] is the list of connectors *we*
//!   wrote down: the URL, whether it needs a token, and the floor under the risk
//!   class a customer may grant its tools. It is a `const`, not a table, which is
//!   argued in its own module docs.
//!
//! Where the claim **stops** is SSH, and it stops hard. A key and a host is a
//! credential for *running programs*, and `agentos_app::mcp`'s module docs spend
//! ninety lines on why this process will not spawn one. The honest shape for a
//! customer's own box is that they run an MCP server on it and give us the URL,
//! which is `catalog::CUSTOM` — a different sentence to the customer than "paste
//! your key", and the only one that is true.
//!
//! [`connect`] is the route that does all of it in one request, and its own doc
//! comment argues why one and not three.
//!
//! **There is now a third shape, and this surface refuses it.**
//! [`catalog::Provision::Host`] is a connector whose server ships only as a
//! stdio package, which we run for the tenant in a container this process does
//! not own — [`agentos_app::hosted`] is the whole design. It is refused here,
//! with a 503 and not a half-write, because no bridge runtime ships in this
//! workspace: there is nothing to start, so there is nothing this route's own
//! rule can be true of. The storage works and `app::mcp` binds such a row when
//! it is handed a runtime; what is missing is the runtime, and saying so with a
//! status code is more honest than storing what the customer typed.
//!
//! # 1. The digest is the operator's, and there is no verb that advances it
//!
//! [`Declaration::digest`](agentos_app::mcp::Declaration::digest) is what makes
//! a granted risk class stick to the tool that was *read* rather than to the
//! name it was read under. A server can redeploy `lookup` with a `callback_url`
//! parameter; if the class travelled with the name, a human's "this is
//! read-only" would silently cover a tool that now exfiltrates on demand.
//!
//! An immutable baseline deletes that attack class. A moving one converts it
//! into a drift-detection problem, which is a thing you have to go looking for.
//! So:
//!
//! * **Nothing here computes a digest and stores it on the operator's behalf.**
//!   [`declare_tool`] takes 64 hex characters from the request body. There is no
//!   "accept current", no `?refresh=true`, no first-write-wins.
//! * **And the digest must be one the server is serving right now.**
//!   [`declare_tool`] binds, finds the tool, and refuses with `digest_mismatch`
//!   unless the bytes match. So the value cannot be invented either: an operator
//!   who has not looked cannot produce it.
//! * **[`discover`] is where they look.** It binds and reports what it found —
//!   every tool, its wire name, the server's own description of it, and the
//!   digest of all three canonicalised together. It writes nothing. Reading it
//!   and then declaring is the whole flow, and it is two requests on purpose:
//!   one that shows, one that decides.
//! * **A `digest_mismatch` does not hand back the correct digest.** It would be
//!   the same two requests with the looking removed, which is the one step this
//!   design exists to force.
//!
//! # 2. Binding is slow and fallible, so it happens in a loop
//!
//! [`McpServer::bind`] resolves DNS, refuses every address that is not globally
//! routable (unless the operator opted the binding into `private`), opens a
//! connection and walks `tools/list`. Seconds, over a network, against an
//! endpoint somebody else operates. That cannot sit on the turn path, and a
//! fleet rebuilt per turn — which is what [`Fleet::bind`]'s own docs flag — pays
//! it on every inbound message.
//!
//! It also cannot sit at boot before the listener: an MCP server that is down
//! would delay or fail a deployment that has nothing else wrong with it.
//!
//! So it belongs where the other slow, fallible, retried work in this binary
//! already lives — a tokio loop next to provisioning, outbox and inbound,
//! cancelled by the same token. [`run`] is that loop, and it wakes on two
//! things:
//!
//! * **A nudge**, sent by every mutation in this module, so an operator's
//!   change is live in this process about as fast as they can refresh the page.
//! * **A tick**, every [`REFRESH`], because a nudge is an in-process channel and
//!   deployments have more than one replica. The replica that did not serve the
//!   `POST` finds out on the tick. It is also the TTL on a cached *risk
//!   classification*, which is the one kind of stale value this whole subsystem
//!   is built to prevent.
//!
//! [`Fleets`] is what the loop writes and what `main` hands to a turn. A server
//! that will not bind is left out of its tenant's [`Fleet`] with the reason
//! recorded — not a panic, not a boot failure, not an empty fleet for the
//! tenant's other servers — and [`list_servers`] renders that reason, because
//! "my tools stopped working" is answered by that string and the operator cannot
//! read the deployment's logs.
//!
//! Two routes here *do* bind inline, and they are the two where that is the
//! point: [`discover`] exists to make the call, and [`declare_tool`] cannot
//! verify a pin without one. Both are an operator's own synchronous admin
//! request under the 30-second request timeout, not the path an inbound email
//! takes.
//!
//! # 3. The tenant comes from the key, and RLS does the rest
//!
//! Every handler opens a [`Db::tenant_tx`] on [`Principal::tenant_id`] and
//! writes no `WHERE tenant_id` of its own — `0013_mcp`'s `tenant_isolation`
//! policies add it, on `USING` and on `WITH CHECK` both.
//! `0019_mcp_operator_writes.sql` is what granted `app_role` the DML to do
//! that; see its header for why the privilege moved out of
//! `admin_tx_bypassing_rls`.
//!
//! Every mutation writes an audit row in the same transaction as the write.
//! These are administrative acts with a real blast radius — binding a URL,
//! granting a risk class — performed by an operator's key, and a change nobody
//! recorded is a change that did not happen.
//!
//! # 4. A credential goes in once and there is no way out
//!
//! The rule is stronger than "no handler returns it", because a rule about what
//! four handlers do is a rule that breaks when a fifth is written. It is enforced
//! in three places, none of which is a handler:
//!
//! * **The type.** `apps/server` never names [`Secret`](agentos_providers::Secret)
//!   and never holds the cipher — it holds an [`agentos_app::mcp::Credentials`],
//!   whose only public operations take a plaintext `String` **in** and hand
//!   ciphertext **out**. There is no signature reachable from this crate that
//!   returns a decrypted credential, so there is nothing here to leak.
//! * **The query.** [`SELECT_SERVERS`] — what the listing reads — does not
//!   project `sealed_token`. It projects `sealed_token IS NOT NULL`. So
//!   [`ServerRow`], which feeds the `Serialize` view, has no field a credential
//!   could occupy, the same construction `store::signing::published_keys` uses
//!   for the private half of a signing key. [`load_binding`] is the one query
//!   that reads the column and it feeds its own non-`Serialize` row type.
//! * **The cipher.** Even the column is not the token: it is an AES-256-GCM
//!   envelope bound by AAD to `(tenant, server)`, so a database dump is not a
//!   credential leak and a row moved one column sideways does not open.
//!
//! What a UI gets instead is `has_credential`. Not `token_last_four`, not a
//! fingerprint: `0040_mcp_credentials` decision 4 argues that a column whose
//! purpose is to be displayed is a column that gets displayed, and a prefix of a
//! credential is a credential.
//!
//! `a_credential_is_taken_once_and_never_comes_back` is the test, and it searches
//! every response, the audit trail, the fleet as it renders, and the raw columns
//! — not a representative sample.

        // leased, not stopped, so a customer who writes a hosted row sorting

        // on the nudge every mutation here sends, so the pass interval is one
        // write.

/// 1. `risk` and `digest` are parsed before anything is contacted — a typo

///    always declare a tool *stricter* than the floor and never more permissive
///    than it. Lowering past it is an operator act and the code already says how
///    one is performed: `app_role` reaches these tables through a tenant
///    transaction and this route, so an operator who genuinely means it writes
///    the row through `Db::admin_tx_bypassing_rls` — a sentence somebody has to
///    type, in a place that is audited by being deliberate, exactly as
///    `0013_mcp` decision 3 described the operator path.
/// 3. The server is bound. A server that cannot be reached cannot have anything
///    declared on it, and that is the *point*: a digest is only ever accepted
///    against a live answer, so there is no way to write one that was not
///    observed.
/// 4. The tool has to exist on it — a 404 naming neither, because a handle that
///    is not in the inventory is not a tool.
/// 5. The digest has to match. If it does not, 409 `digest_mismatch`, and the
///    response does **not** carry the digest that would have worked. Handing it
///    over would turn the two-request flow into one request and a copy, with
