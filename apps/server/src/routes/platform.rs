//! `/v1/platform`: step zero — a customer arriving, and a credential they can
//! lose without taking everybody else down with them.
//!
//! # The question this file exists to answer: who may issue a key
//!
//! It is the hard half, and the two easy answers are both wrong.
//!
//! **"A tenant issues its own keys."** This is what every SaaS console does and
//! it is exactly what must not happen here, for one reason: *a stolen key would
//! mint more*. Revocation would then be a race against whoever holds the key,
//! and losing that race is silent — the attacker's second key has a different id
//! and a different digest and looks like every other key the customer ever
//! asked for. Revocation that a compromised credential can undo is not
//! revocation. So there is **no route anywhere in this server that mints a key
//! for the caller's own tenant**, and `auth::Principal` is not accepted by any
//! handler in this file.
//!
//! **"The operator does it with a shell."** This is what the deployment already
//! does for the thing with the same shape — the platform policy ceiling, whose
//! row belongs to no tenant, is written by `agentos-server policy install`, on
//! the strength of `DATABASE_URL` and nothing else. `apps/server/src/policy.rs`
//! argues that at length and the argument is right about ceilings. It is only a
//! *partial* answer here, and it says so itself:
//!
//! > What a route would add, if one is ever wanted: a hosted control plane where
//! > the *vendor* — not a tenant — widens the ceiling for a customer without
//! > shell access to the box. Build it when there is a platform principal to
//! > authenticate.
//!
//! A subcommand cannot be step zero. A customer filling in a form cannot ssh
//! anywhere, and "the founder runs a command per signup" is the same ceiling as
//! the environment variable wearing a different hat: the customer's first step
//! is still a human being of ours.
//!
//! # So: a platform principal, and it is not a tenant
//!
//! [`PlatformPrincipal`] comes from `AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEYS`, holds no tenant id,
//! and is a different Rust type from `auth::Principal`. That is the enforcement,
//! not a convention:
//!
//! * Every route that reads tenant data extracts `auth::Principal`, and only
//!   `auth::require_api_key` ever inserts one. A platform key presented there is
//!   a string that is not in the tenant keyring — a 401, the same as a typo.
//! * Every route in this file extracts [`PlatformPrincipal`], and only
//!   `auth::require_platform_key` inserts one. A tenant's key presented here is
//!   a string that is not in the platform keyring.
//!
//! **What that makes impossible.** A stolen tenant key cannot issue a key,
//! cannot revoke one, cannot create a tenant, and cannot see that any of these
//! endpoints exist. Revoking it therefore ends the incident. A stolen platform
//! key cannot read one row of one tenant's data with the credential it is — it
//! has to *issue itself a key first*, and that issuance is an `api_key_issued`
//! row in the victim's own append-only trail, naming the label the thief chose,
//! in a table `app_role` holds no DELETE on and a trigger refuses to UPDATE even
//! for a superuser. A total compromise of the vendor is therefore loud rather
//! than silent, which is the most a design can promise about the credential that
//! sits at the root.
//!
//! **What it makes possible.** A signup form. The vendor's front end holds the
//! platform key, `POST /v1/platform/tenants` returns a working credential in one
//! call, and the customer's next request is `GET /v1/whoami` with a key nobody
//! deployed. That is the step that did not exist.
//!
//! # Why these routes are not behind `with_api_stack`
//!
//! Because that stack *is* `auth::require_api_key` — a platform key would be
//! refused by it before any handler ran. They sit in the outer stack (request
//! id, trace, body limit, timeout) with `require_platform_key` in front, which
//! is the same shape `routes::webhooks` uses for the same reason: a credential
//! this server understands, that is not a tenant's.
//!
//! ponytail: no rate limiter and no idempotency layer on this tier. Both are
//! keyed on a tenant that does not exist yet, and the two writes here are
//! protected by uniqueness instead — a replayed signup collides on
//! `tenants_slug_key`, a replayed issue collides on `api_keys_tenant_label_key`,
//! and both answer 409 rather than quietly making a second of anything.
