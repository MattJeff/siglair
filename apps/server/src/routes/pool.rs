//! `/v1/pool`: the shared phone numbers, who is on them, and who reaches whom.
//!
//! ```text
//! GET  /v1/pool/numbers                 the numbers, region, bundle, capacity, occupancy
//! POST /v1/pool/numbers                 put a number the tenant owns into the pool
//! GET  /v1/pool/routing                 counterparty -> employee, and whether it still routes
//! POST /v1/pool/numbers/{id}/reassign   hand one counterparty to another employee
//! ```
//!
//! # Where the numbers come from
//!
//! `phone_numbers`, read per request inside the caller's own [`TenantTx`]. Not
//! from configuration and not from a process-wide cache: which numbers a tenant
//! shares is a per-tenant fact that an operator changes with a bundle in hand,
//! and a cached copy of it is a copy that one replica can serve stale after
//! another replica's `POST`. There is no refresh tick here and no cross-replica
//! nudge because there is nothing held to go stale — the pool is five to ten
//! rows on an index, and the read that removes the question is cheaper than the
//! machinery that would have answered it.
//!
//! `POST /v1/pool/numbers` is what closes the loop: without it the table could
//! only be filled by a migration or by hand, which is why this router used to be
//! unmountable. It is an upsert on `(tenant, e164)`, so re-posting a number
//! whose bundle has since cleared is also how `pending_regulatory` becomes
//! `active` — one endpoint, because a number's paperwork moving is the same
//! operator writing down the same number.
//!
//! # Why an operator needs this at all
//!
//! With a dedicated number per employee, "who does this supplier reach?" has a
//! trivial answer: the owner of the number they dialled. Pool the numbers and
//! that answer moves into
//! [`agentos_app::inbound::resolve_phone_recipient`]'s arbitration
//! rules, where nobody can see it. A mis-route then looks like an employee
//! ignoring a supplier, and the operator has no way to tell the two apart.
//! `GET /v1/pool/routing` is the difference between a diagnosable system and a
//! haunted one — it renders the arbitration's answer, per counterparty, with
//! the reason a row is not routable.
//!
//! # Reassign is an action, not a setting
//!
//! Moving a supplier from Lena to Alex decides which employee a counterparty
//! talks to for the rest of the relationship, and the psyche does **not** move
//! with it: Lena keeps the trust links, the learned expectations and the
//! beliefs she built about that supplier, and Alex starts from the prior. So it
//! goes through the Policy Gate like every other effect in this system, and
//! lands in the audit trail twice over — the gate's own ruling, and a row here
//! naming the number, the counterparty and both employees.
//!
//! The gate is consulted *before* anything moves, and it is consulted about the
//! **receiving** employee, because "is Alex allowed to take on this supplier"
//! includes "is Alex still active", which is precisely the check that stops an
//! operator handing a supplier to somebody who left last week.
//!
//! # Shape
//!
//! Behind the API key, tenant from the credential and never from a path or a
//! body, RFC 9457 problem+json on every failure, keyset pagination on both
//! reads — the same shape as `routes/employees.rs` and `routes/inventory.rs`,
//! deliberately, because a third house style is a third thing to learn.
