//! `POST /v1/employees/{id}/queue/export`: the file the founder uploads.
//!
//! [`agentos_app::queue`] shipped with ten unit tests, a compile-fail case and
//! no caller. This is the caller, and there is exactly one of it, because the
//! module's own rule leaves room for exactly one shape:
//!
//! > **Commit `record_queued` before writing the file.**
//!
//! A cadence cannot honour that. A `Lead` it built would live in one process's
//! memory, so marking a prospect contacted for it records a person as approached
//! who was never approached — the one bookkeeping error in this vertical that
//! costs a real prospect. So the export is a **pull**: [`queue::plan`], `record_queued`
//! and [`queue::csv`] run in one transaction, and that transaction commits before the
//! bytes leave the process, in the same request that hands them to the person
//! who will upload them.
//!
//! # `POST`, and it is not a matter of taste
//!
//! This marks up to forty strangers as contacted and moves their follow-up
//! clocks three days out. Running it twice returns two different files; the
//! second is usually empty, which is the point. That is a write, and a `GET`
//! that writes is a `GET` some proxy, link-prefetcher, browser or retry policy
//! will eventually run for you — spending the founder's day of prospects on
//! nobody. The `Accept`-shaped thing about it, that a file comes back, is not
//! evidence about the verb.
//!
//! It carries no request body on purpose: everything the export needs is
//! already a stored value. A body would be a second place to write a limit.
//!
//! # The lost response, which is the interesting failure
//!
//! The rows are marked and the bytes are built in one transaction, so those two
//! cannot disagree. What can still happen is that the transaction commits and
//! the **response** never arrives — the client disconnects, the proxy times out.
//! Then forty people are marked contacted and nobody has the file.
//!
//! That is the failure the module chooses, and this follows it rather than
//! arguing: mark-then-send loses an opener for `FOLLOW_UP_AFTER` (72 hours), send-then-
//! mark mails a stranger the same cold email twice. A prospect who gets that
//! reports it, and a sending domain does not recover from that on a schedule.
//! One is three days of silence for forty prospects; the other is the reputation
//! of the only domain the company sends on.
//!
//! **But it is recoverable, and that is why the response is JSON.** The API
//! stack already replays a keyed request from a stored record —
//! `main::replay_idempotent` — and it records **only** JSON responses, because
//! the column is `jsonb`. A `text/csv` body would be released rather than
//! recorded, so a retry would re-run the handler and get the *empty* file the
//! second run correctly produces, and the lost openers would stay lost. Sent as
//! `{"queued": n, "csv": "…"}` under an `Idempotency-Key`, a retry replays the
//! exact same bytes. The founder's command is:
//!
//! ```text
//! curl -sX POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
//!      -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
//!      "$HOST/v1/employees/$ID/queue/export" | jq -r .csv > leads.csv
//! ```
//!
//! Reuse that key to retry. A new key is a new day's export.
//!
//! # Every refusal the send path applies
//!
//! None of them is re-derived here — a second place to write a limit is one
//! place to forget to tighten it. [`queue::plan`] applies all four, from values this
//! handler only fetches:
//!
//! * **Suppression** — [`queue::suppression`], through the schema's own
//!   `SECURITY DEFINER` lookup, which is the only reader that can see a
//!   *global* suppression. The database says it twice more: an opt-out
//!   deactivates the contact rows it names *and* clears their
//!   `next_follow_up_at`, and [`queue::due`] filters on both.
//! * **`max_new_contacts_per_day` minus today** — the limit through
//!   [`policy::load`], so it is the intersected platform ∧ tenant ∧ team ∧
//!   employee number the gate itself enforces, and not the role pack's shipped
//!   `0` nor an employee layer a team has since tightened. Today's spend
//!   through [`contacted_since`](agentos_store::revenue::contacted_since) from
//!   UTC midnight, which is the column `record_queued` writes and the same day
//!   boundary the turn ledger keys on. **That count is read with no lock**, and
//!   the selection under it takes `FOR UPDATE OF c SKIP LOCKED` — so two pulls
//!   at once get disjoint prospects, neither blocks, and both used to take the
//!   whole day. [`agentos_store::outreach::reserve`] is the row lock that closes
//!   it, taken in the transaction below, before anybody is marked.
//! * **`may_propose(EmailSend)` and `Channel::Email`** — the sales role pack's,
//!   carrying those loaded limits.
//!
//! And one the send path has no need of, because it never holds a claim for
//! longer than a turn: **`MAX_FINDING_AGE` on the opener**. A file is uploaded
//! by hand a day later; the sentence in it names a date and says *"here is how
//! to see it again"*. [`queue::due`] applies the bar in SQL, on the same
//! `checked_at` `vertical::follow_up` measures.
//!
//! # The tenant, and the employee
//!
//! From [`Principal`], i.e. from the API key, never from the path. The employee
//! id in the path selects *whose limits* — it is not an authorisation and it
//! cannot widen anything. Another tenant's employee is invisible to RLS and
//! answered **404**, not 403, which would confirm the id exists.
//!
//! The export itself is tenant-wide rather than per-employee: `contacts` are not
//! assigned to an employee, `contacted_since` counts the tenant's day, and the
//! founder has one seller. If a second one is ever hired, the two would share
//! one budget through this route — the fix is a `WHERE a.employee_id = $n` in
//! [`queueable`](agentos_store::revenue::queueable), and it is not written
//! because a column nobody fills makes every export empty.
//!
//! # An empty export is a 200
//!
//! With the header row, `queued: 0`. Nothing is wrong with a quiet morning: no
//! finding was fresh, or yesterday spent the budget, or the operator has not
//! raised it off `0` yet. A 404 would say the resource does not exist and a 4xx
//! would say the founder made a mistake, and neither is true. The header row is
//! there because Smartlead's importer needs one to map columns, so an empty file
//! that still loads is worth more than an empty body.
//!
//! # September, and what this route does now
//!
//! The second sink is built: [`queue::push`], over the same `&[Lead]` slice this
//! handler already holds. Which one runs is one `if` in [`export`], on
//! [`may_upload_leads`](agentos_domain::policy::may_upload_leads) — a
//! `PolicyLimits` flag that intersects across platform ∧ tenant ∧ role ∧
//! employee and is `false` in every document this repository ships. **What is
//! delivered is the export**, and turning it on is an operator writing a policy
//! layer, not a deploy.
//!
//! Two things about the send path differ from the file path and neither is
//! optional:
//!
//! * **[`queue::reconcile_opt_outs`] runs first**, before [`queue::due`] is
//!   asked anything. An unsubscribe that happened on the platform lives only
//!   there until somebody asks, and the moment it matters is the moment a queue
//!   is about to be built.
//! * **The push happens after the commit**, not inside it. It has to:
//!   `PolicyGate::authorize` opens its own transaction, and no HTTP call may run
//!   with one of ours held open. That is the same mark-then-write trade this
//!   route already made, and `queue::push` restates it.
//!
//! What is **not** built is the adapter behind the trait — one campaign id and
//! one read endpoint the founder has to name. See [`agentos_providers::leads`]
//! and this crate's `mocks`, where the absence is argued rather than faked.
