//! `/v1/teams` and `/v1/org`: the org chart, over HTTP.
//!
//! `0012_org.sql` and [`agentos_store::org`] shipped together and neither of
//! them can be reached from outside the process: a team could only be created
//! by a Rust caller. This module is the door, and it is deliberately a narrow
//! one — everything here is an *administrative* act performed by an operator's
//! API key, not an action an employee takes, so nothing on this surface goes
//! through the Policy Gate and everything on it writes an audit row.
//!
//! # One call, or twenty
//!
//! [`apply_org`] is the door an operator should use, and every `/v1/teams`
//! route below is the same surface one field at a time. The seven-row table an
//! operator draws was roughly twenty calls — create team, set mission, hire,
//! seat, point the line, per row — with **no transaction across them**, so any
//! failure in the middle left teams with no heads and employees reporting into
//! seats that were never made. That is not a state to retry; it is a state to
//! reason about first, and nobody can. `POST /v1/org` is the whole table in one
//! `TenantTx`. The single-field routes stay because editing one mission is not
//! re-declaring a company.
//!
//! # What a route may not do
//!
//! **It may not write a limit.** A team's policy lives in `policy_layers` under
//! a `role_name`, which is where `store::policy::load` already reads it and
//! already intersects it with the tenant's. [`set_policy_role`] moves a
//! *pointer*; nothing on **this** surface sets a cap, a channel or an allowlist,
//! because two places to write a limit is one place to forget to tighten. The
//! place that writes one is `agentos-server policy install --tenant …
//! --role <name>`, on the operator's own database credential — see
//! `apps::server::policy` for why a route here would have been defensible on
//! authorisation grounds and was still not built.
//!
//! The one exception is `routes::companies`, and it is drawn precisely so this
//! sentence keeps its meaning: `POST /v1/companies` may write a role layer for a
//! role that has **none**, which — because an absent layer inherits the layer
//! above and the loader intersects — cannot widen anything, and it answers `409`
//! for a role that already has one. There is still exactly one place to *change*
//! a limit. What that route does that this one must not is stand a company up
//! from nothing; editing one is still this surface, one field at a time. The
//! direct consequence, and the thing to tell an operator once: **a team can only
//! ever tighten.** The loader takes the minimum of each cap across platform ∧
//! tenant ∧ role ∧ employee, so a role layer naming a wider number than the
//! tenant's is silently the tenant's. `docs/TEAMS.md` says this in the place an
//! operator will actually read it.
//!
//! **It may not give a section limits.** Sections are an org chart and nothing
//! else — no `team_policy` row, no `team_budgets` row, no endpoint here that
//! would create one. A section with limits is a fifth layer in a four-layer
//! intersection.
//!
//! **It may not put an employee on a second team.** `team_memberships`' primary
//! key is `(tenant_id, employee_id)`, and [`add_member`] refuses a second one
//! with a 409 that names the team the employee is already on. That refusal is
//! the primary key's, not a `SELECT` this handler ran first: two operators
//! adding the same employee to two different teams would both read "no team"
//! and the loser's write would win. [`move_member`] is the explicit way to
//! change it, and it records where the employee came from.
//!
//! # The three columns of an org chart
//!
//! What an operator actually draws is a table — *function, head, mission* —
//! and each column is one thing on this surface:
//!
//! | column | where it lives | endpoint |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | **Fonction** | a `teams` row | [`create_team`] |
//! | **Responsable** | `title` + `reports_to` on that employee's membership | [`move_member`] |
//! | **Mission** | `teams.mission` | [`set_mission`] |
//!
//! **A position is not a table.** "Head of Growth" is the seat on the growth
//! team whose title says so, and a seat is the membership row an employee
//! already has: one employee, one team, one title, one manager. "CEO" is the
//! seat whose `reports_to` is null — a seat with nobody above it, not a special
//! kind of row and emphatically not a role pack, which is a vertical's playbook
//! and not an org box.
//!
//! **Only [`move_member`] writes a position.** [`add_member`] puts somebody on
//! a team and leaves the seat untitled, which is what an individual contributor
//! is; naming the seat and pointing the reporting line is one idempotent `PUT`,
//! so there is exactly one handler to read when asking how an org chart got the
//! shape it has. That `PUT` replaces the *whole* seat, section and title and
//! manager together, because a seat is one thing and half-updating it leaves an
//! org chart nobody edited on purpose.
//!
//! **Seniority is not a permission, and no endpoint here could make it one.**
//! Every limit is still a `policy_layers` row reached through the team's
//! `role_name`; `reports_to` is not joined by `store::policy::load` and there is
//! no verb on this surface that widens anything. A head is an employee that
//! other employees answer to — that is all it is — and what it buys is the
//! right to set *their* charters, ruled on by the Policy Gate one subordinate
//! at a time (`app::vertical::delegate`).
//!
//! **A head cannot be removed out from under its reports.** [`remove_member`]
//! refuses with a 409 that names them, and the composite foreign key refuses it
//! again underneath. An org chart that quietly orphans half a department is
//! worse than one that will not change without being told what to do about it.
//!
//! # The tenant
//!
//! From [`Principal`], i.e. from the API key, never from a path or a body.
//! Every handler that takes a `team_id` loads the team first, so another
//! tenant's id is a 404 rather than a foreign-key violation rendered as a 500.
//! The same goes for `employee_id`: referential-integrity checks bypass RLS in
//! Postgres, so an FK on `employees` would happily accept another tenant's
//! employee — [`employee_in_tenant`] is what stops a membership row being filed
//! for someone else's agent.

/// failure a new column must never cause. There is no backfill available to

/// that exist are taking turns; refusing the next one stops none of them. It
/// would be a gesture at a symptom while the cause continues, and the cause has

///
/// What makes leaving it open *safe* is that hiring is not acting. A seat hired

/// **What is genuinely open, and it is not a window question.**
