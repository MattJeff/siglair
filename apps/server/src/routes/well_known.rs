//! `GET /.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory`: the public keys a
//! counterparty verifies our signatures with.
//!
//! # Public and unauthenticated, which is the entire point
//!
//! A verifier is by definition somebody we have no relationship with. They
//! received a signed A2A request or a signed message, they have a `kid`, and
//! they need the key. A key directory behind an API key is a key directory
//! nobody can use, in exactly the way an agent card behind an API key is — see
//! [`crate::routes::a2a`], which mounts for the same reason on the same tier.
//!
//! So this router goes **outside** `with_api_stack`, and every line below is
//! written on the assumption that the caller is hostile.
//!
//! # What it can leak, which is nothing but public keys
//!
//! Three layers, in order, and none of them is "the handler is careful":
//!
//! 1. **The query cannot fetch the private half.**
//!    [`agentos_store::signing::published_keys`] selects `public_key` and
//!    nothing else. `sealed_private_key` is not in the projection, not in the
//!    row type, and not in any value reachable from here.
//! 2. **The document type cannot hold anything else.**
//!    [`agentos_domain::identity::jwks`] takes `PublicKey` values — 32 bytes,
//!    no other fields — so the response is structurally incapable of carrying
//!    a slug, an address, a lifecycle or a tenant id. A JWKS with a seventh
//!    member is a compile error, not a review catch.
//! 3. **Row-level security bounds the read to one tenant.** See below.
//!
//! It deliberately does *not* echo the employee's name, address or
//! capabilities. That is the agent card's job, the agent card is a separate
//! document a peer asks for on purpose, and merging them would mean every
//! verifier fetch also hands out a profile.
//!
//! # How a verifier knows which tenant a key belongs to
//!
//! **It does not, and it must not need to.** `PUBLIC_HOST` is one origin
//! serving many tenants, so the host answers nothing on its own. The binding a
//! verifier actually relies on is the one it already has: it fetched *this
//! URL* because our signature told it to, and the document at this URL lists
//! the keys that URL vouches for. That is the same trust model as Web Bot
//! Auth's directory and as `did:web` — the URL is the identifier, and the key
//! set is what the identifier attests to. Adding a `tenant` field to the
//! document would not strengthen it by one bit: a document that names its own
//! tenant is a document that could name any tenant.
//!
//! What has to be true, then, is that the URL is unambiguous and that the
//! document behind it can only ever contain the right tenant's keys. Both are:
//!
//! * **The URL is scoped by `?employee=<uuid>`**, exactly the selector
//!   [`crate::routes::a2a`] already puts in the agent card's interface URL, and
//!   resolved by the same [`crate::routes::a2a::discover`] — one rule for
//!   "which employee is this endpoint about", not two that can drift. As there,
//!   the parameter is optional and a single-employee deployment may omit it;
//!   a deployment with more than one employee answers 400 rather than guessing.
//! * **The tenant is derived from the employee, never from the request.** The
//!   handler resolves employee → tenant, then opens `tenant_tx` for *that*
//!   tenant, and the RLS policy in `0014_identity.sql` makes every other
//!   tenant's rows invisible for the life of the transaction. A caller cannot
//!   name a tenant, so a caller cannot widen the document.
//!
//! Scoped to an employee rather than to a whole tenant on purpose. A
//! tenant-wide directory would let anyone holding one employee's URL enumerate
//! every colleague — headcount, ids and hiring rate, from an unauthenticated
//! endpoint. A verifier only ever needs the key that signed the thing in front
//! of it.
//!
//! # Leaving the did:web door open
//!
//! `/.well-known/did.json` over these same rows is a second rendering of
//! [`agentos_domain::identity::PublicKey`] and would be another handler in this
//! file — the storage, the scoping and the tenant resolution are already
//! whatever it would need. It is not built, because nothing has asked for it
//! and the DID crates are not worth depending on; see
//! `agentos_domain::identity`.
//!
//! ponytail: no `Cache-Control`. The correct max-age depends on how fast an
//! operator expects a suspension to take effect — publication is
//! lifecycle-gated, so suspending an employee withdraws its key — and that is a
//! deployment decision for the ingress proxy, which is also the thing that
//! should be absorbing this traffic.

// `DIRECTORY_PATH` is the path Cloudflare's Web Bot Auth directory uses, and
// the reason this module exists rather than a `did:web` one. It is a literal in
// the domain crate, never assembled from a prefix — a well-known path built out
// of parts is a well-known path somebody eventually re-prefixes — and it lives
// there rather than here because it is now read from both ends:
// `agentos_app::peer_keys` fetches a *peer's* directory at the same path, and
// two spellings of it would be two protocols.
