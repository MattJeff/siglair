//! The whole thing, once, as a client sees it.
//!
//! Every other test in this workspace mounts a router in-process. This one
//! starts the **real binary** against a **real database**, talks to it over a
//! socket with `curl`, and asserts on what comes back. That is the only way to
//! check the things wiring can get wrong and a unit test cannot see:
//!
//! * the routers are actually merged into `app()`, at the paths they claim;
//! * the loops are actually spawned, because nothing else moves an employee out
//!   of `pending` — the provisioning loop has to do it on its own, from a
//!   cold start, with nobody driving it;
//! * the API stack is on the routes that need it and off the ones that must
//!   not have it;
//! * SIGTERM stops the process, loops and all, instead of hanging.
//!
//! # Its own database
//!
//! Created here and dropped at the end. The A2A card resolves "this
//! deployment's one active employee", the outbox poller is cross-tenant, and
//! the provisioning loop claims every tenant's rows — all three are correct
//! behaviours that make a shared database a source of interference rather than
//! a source of test failures worth reading. The server migrates it on boot,
//! which is itself part of what is under test.
//!
//! `curl`, not an HTTP client crate, because the deliverable is the curl
//! output and because `agentos-server` has no client dependency to reach for.
//!
//! # The second test: the life of a company
//!
//! [`a_company_is_drawn_takes_a_turn_talks_to_itself_and_meets_the_gate`] shares
//! this harness and drives the arc a deployment actually has — an org chart, a
//! ceiling, a turn, a colleague, money — because every bug found in this
//! workspace so far has been at a seam and not inside a unit. Four routers
//! written and never merged, a gate that never read stored policy, `spend_caps`
//! with no writer, and three waves of an internal channel that was complete,
//! tested and unreachable: not one of those is visible from inside the module
//! that contains it, and every one of them is visible from a test that makes
//! the whole company do something. See that test's own header for what it can
//! and cannot reach.

/// written and never merged, a gate that never read stored policy, `spend_caps`
/// with no writer, a purchasing vertical with no caller, and — three waves
/// running — an internal channel that was complete, tested and *unreachable*
/// because two role packs omitted one enum variant. None of those is expressible
/// as a unit test failure. All of them are expressible as "the company does not
/// work", which is what this drives:
///
/// 1. an org chart is drawn and the reporting lines it asked for exist;
/// 2. before a ceiling exists the deployment refuses to be ready **and** refuses
///    the action — fail-closed, proven rather than described — and installing
///    one the way an operator does turns both around;
/// 3. the CEO orders its Head of Growth across two teams, and a peer is refused;
/// 4. that order wakes a turn, and the request the server builds for the model
///    carries *its* colleagues and *its* role's tools, not the company's — and
///    the turn answers with a tool call that comes back down the line;
/// 5. money is allowed, escalated and denied at the ceiling's three bands;
/// 6. the audit trail says all of that happened and nothing else did.
///
/// # Where the assertions are made
///
/// Steps 1, 2 and 5's configuration are entirely over the wire, and step 4 is
/// asserted on bytes the server wrote to a subprocess. Steps 3 and 5's rulings
/// hold the gate's own `Authorized<A>`, because **there is no HTTP door to
/// either** and that is a fact about this architecture rather than a shortcut
/// here — `docs/TEAMS.md` says so of delegation in as many words, and no route
/// in `app()` proposes a payment. What makes them more than unit tests is that
/// every input is state the *server* wrote: the org chart came out of
/// `POST /v1/org`, the ceiling out of the operator subcommand, the budget out of
/// `PUT …/budget`, the caps out of `PUT …/spend-caps`, the charter out of
/// `PUT …/initiative`. The gate reads rows this test never wrote.
///
/// # What it cannot reach, named rather than skipped
///
/// * **A payment reaches the port and no further.** `mocks::ports_for` binds
///   `payments` to `NotConfigured`, which refuses by design — this build has no
///   payment rail and picking one is SPEC §13's open decision. Two observable
///   things are asserted past the ruling, and they are on two different paths.
///   A payment an employee is *allowed* to make goes through `Effects::pay`,
///   reaches the port, is refused, and the ledger *gives the money back*. A
///   payment a **human approves** never reaches the port at all: the route asks
///   the port whether this deployment can pay before it redeems, so the answer
///   is `501 no_payment_rail` and the approval is left `pending` — spendable
///   the day a rail exists, where it used to be burned for nothing.
/// * **A webhook cannot start a turn on a deployment running mocks.** The
///   route stores a notice, the inbound loop then asks the provider for the
///   body, and `MockEmailProvider`'s inbox is filled by `seed_inbound` — an
///   in-process call with no HTTP or environment seam. The loop retries
///   `not_ready` until the attempt budget runs out. The other test in this file
///   asserts as far as the notice, which is as far as that path goes from
///   outside; everything past it is unreachable without a real email provider.
/// * **The initiative loop's own turn is never observed.** `Cadence::every`
///   floors a cadence at five minutes, so reaching it means sleeping past it or
///   moving `employee_initiative.next_at` by hand.
