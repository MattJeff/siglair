//! `docs/ORIZN.md`, executed.
//!
//! The runbook stands a company up in six steps against a real database. This
//! file runs all six — the real binary, the real migrations, the real
//! `policy install`, the real `policy new-tenant`, the real `POST /v1/org` —
//! and then asserts that the company on the other side is the one the document
//! describes.
//!
//! **There is no `psql` left in it, and that is recent.** Three of these steps
//! used to be hand-written SQL, because no route and no subcommand wrote a
//! tenant row, a tenant/role/employee `policy_layers` row, or the active
//! `policy_versions` row the role layers hang off. All three are commands now,
//! and this file runs them as the operator does.
//!
//! The documents are the company, and this test reads the *same documents* the
//! operator does. Edit `docs/orizn-org.json` and this test changes with it;
//! edit a file in `docs/orizn-roles/` and this test **fails**, because the
//! numbers are the one thing it keeps its own copy of. That asymmetry is
//! deliberate: the org chart is a document whose content is its own
//! specification, and the policy layer is a set of decisions somebody argued
//! for in prose. A test that re-derived the limits from the documents would
//! agree with any documents at all.
//!
//! # The two claims that are not "the rows exist"
//!
//! **The ceiling is load-bearing.** `/readyz` is asserted red *before*
//! `policy install` and green after. A deployment with no platform layer has no
//! ceiling and the gate refuses everything; that is the safe direction and it
//! is the first thing an operator sees.
//!
//! **Nothing this company writes tries to widen.** For every role, the raw
//! `policy_layers` row is compared against what `store::policy::load` returns
//! after intersecting it with the ceiling. They must be equal. A layer that
//! named a number *bigger* than
//! the ceiling would still be safe — the loader takes the minimum — but the row
//! an operator reads would no longer be the row the gate rules with, and the
//! next person to open `psql` would believe a limit that does not exist.
//!
//! # Two ways in, one standard
//!
//! There are two of these tests now, because there are two ways to stand this
//! company up: the runbook's nine steps, and `POST /v1/companies`, which is
//! steps 3, 4 and 5 in one request. They share
//! [`assert_the_company_is_orizn`] — **the same function, not a second list** —
//! and that sharing is the whole proof that the route cannot build a wider
//! company than the runbook does. Two copies of the expectations could drift
//! apart and then agree with each other about the wrong thing; one cannot.
//! Widening a number in `docs/orizn-roles/` fails both tests, on the same line.
//!
//! The route's own test owns what the runbook has no equivalent of: that no
//! ceiling is a refusal rather than a permissive default, that a chart naming a
//! team with no role layer is refused by name, that a company with no operating
//! window is refused rather than given an invented one, that a call cut in the
//! middle leaves limits without employees and never the reverse, and that
//! replaying it repairs rather than duplicates.
//!
//! # What this test does not run
//!
//! No turn, no model call, no payment. `AGENTOS_LLM=mock` and the mock adapters
//! are on: every claim here is about configuration, and the vertical that
//! exercises the gate end to end is `sourcing_e2e.rs`. What this file owns is
//! narrower and nothing else covers it — that the document, the SQL and the
//! running company agree.

///    a company with no window runs until somebody notices, on the customer's
///    own model credential, and no duration is invented to fill the gap.

///    leaves has limits and no employees rather than employees and no limits —
///    and no window, because the window is written in the chart's own
///    transaction.
/// 6. **The company is the runbook's**, asserted by
///    [`assert_the_company_is_orizn`] — the same function, not a copy of it,
///    which is what makes "the route cannot build a wider company" a fact rather
///    than a claim about two lists that could drift.
///
/// And one more, which is the line this route is drawn on: it may *create* and
/// may never *replace*. Creating a limit can only narrow (an absent layer
/// inherits, and intersection is monotone) and creating a window can only close
