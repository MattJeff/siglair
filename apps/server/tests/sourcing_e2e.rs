//! The buyer vertical, once, as a purchasing round actually happens.
//!
//! Every layer of this vertical is unit-tested in isolation: the domain
//! (`domain::sourcing`, `domain::psyche`), the store (`store::sourcing`,
//! `store::psyche`), the role (`app::rolepack`), the buyer operations
//! (`app::sourcing`) and the agent loop (`app::turn`). None of those tests can
//! fail if the layers do not fit together, because none of them ever puts two
//! of the layers in the same function. This one does.
//!
//! It starts the **real binary** against a **real database**, creates an
//! employee over HTTP, and waits for the server's own provisioning loop to make
//! it active — because an employee the gate would refuse every action for is a
//! row, not a buyer. Then it stops the server and runs one purchasing round
//! against that employee, in this process, on the same database:
//!
//! 1. an RFQ to five suppliers, of which the outreach budget covers four;
//! 2. quotes back in **two currencies and three incoterms**, compared on
//!    **landed cost** and on nothing else;
//! 3. one quote expired — excluded twice over, by the type system and by SQL;
//! 4. a supplier's reply telling the employee to wire a deposit now, which
//!    reaches the gate as untrusted and produces **no effect at all**;
//! 5. an order, which is always a question for a human;
//! 6. what the psyche kept about the supplier that answered and the one that
//!    did not, with the founding episodes still citable;
//! 7. the audit trail, in which every effect names the decision that let it
//!    happen.
//!
//! # The model is scripted
//!
//! `ScriptedLlm` — deterministic, no API key, no spend. The one turn that runs
//! here is the one that matters: a turn whose context contains a supplier's
//! email is untrusted, so the payment tool is not in the schemas at all, and a
//! model that names it anyway is denied by the gate and audited.
//!
//! # What this test found and did not paper over
//!
//! Four seams that did not line up were bridged **in this file, in the open**,
//! rather than asserted around. Two of them have since been closed in the
//! product and the bridges are gone: there is now exactly one `Incoterm` in the
//! workspace (the domain's, re-exported by `app::sourcing`), and
//! `app::sourcing::Quote::live_at` is the only way into a comparison, so a stale
//! price cannot be ranked. The two that remain are marked `GAP n` where the
//! bridge is written — no way to give an employee a role, and a `quotes` table
//! that cannot hold two currencies against one RFQ.
//!
//! What this test asserts about the psyche is the **durable** half, through
//! `store::psyche`: a belief that names the episodes it was founded on, and a
//! `store::sourcing` reputation that tells the supplier who answered from the
//! one who did not. That is deliberate and no longer a workaround — this line
//! used to say `crates/domain/src/psyche/mod.rs` declares `pub mod links;` and
//! nothing else, so `beliefs.rs`, `expectation.rs` and `forgetting.rs` are not
//! in the build, and it has not been true since all four were declared. The
//! in-memory half has its own suite next to the code it is about; what an
//! end-to-end test can add is that the rows survive the round trip, which is
//! the half a unit test cannot reach.
