//! Talking to other people's agents.
//!
//! A2A is the protocol where a program we do not run, written by a company we
//! do not control, sends our employee instructions. Everything in this module
//! follows from that one sentence:
//!
//! * **The body is data.** An inbound message becomes [`Untrusted<String>`]
//!   before it is anything else, and it stays wrapped all the way into
//!   [`AgentRuntime::respond`]. The type has no `Display`, no `Deref` and no
//!   `Into<String>`, so it cannot be spliced into a prompt or a subject line by
//!   accident. A remote agent asking for a wire transfer is a *string that
//!   says so*, and the gate refuses high-risk actions carrying that taint.
//! * **The caller is not.** *Which* peer is calling is established by the
//!   authentication layer, not by the message, so it can be gated on. Every
//!   inbound call goes through [`GateInterceptor`] as an
//!   [`Action::A2aSend`] against the peer allowlist, which produces one audit
//!   row per call whether it was allowed or refused.
//! * **Tasks outlive us.** The SDK's task store is in memory and says so. A
//!   peer keeps its task id across our deploy; if a restart turns `GetTask`
//!   into `TASK_NOT_FOUND` for work we really did, the peer has no way to find
//!   out what happened. [`PgTaskStore`] puts the task in Postgres, under the
//!   tenant's row-level security.
//!
//! # The version header
//!
//! `A2A-Version` is mandatory to *handle*, not to receive: an absent header
//! means a pre-1.0 client, which the spec pins at [`LEGACY_VERSION`]. A version
//! we cannot serve gets JSON-RPC `-32009`, not a best-effort guess — guessing
//! is how a 2.x client ends up believing our 1.0 answer.
//!
//! # Outbound calls are signed; the card is not
//!
//! [`sign_request`] puts an RFC 9421 signature on a request we send, so a peer
//! can check it against the JWKS at
//! [`DIRECTORY_PATH`](agentos_domain::identity::DIRECTORY_PATH). Read
//! [`crate::http_signature`] for the format and [`crate::identity`] for why the
//! `Authorized<A2aSend>` that permitted the *call* is the same token that
//! permits signing it — there is no `Action::Sign`, because a bare signing
//! authorization is a signing oracle.
//!
//! The **card** is still shipped unsigned. `AgentCard::signatures` stays `None`
//! because that field wants a JWS over the card document, which is a different
//! format from the one on the wire, and this SDK implements none of it; a
//! hand-rolled JWS that no client verifies is worse than an honest absence.
//! The card is also the one document whose authenticity a peer establishes by
//! *fetching it from us over TLS*, which is the same trust root the signature
//! directory has. v1.0 also removed `url`,
//! `preferredTransport` and the top-level `protocolVersion` in favour of
//! `supportedInterfaces[]`; we declare exactly one interface, JSON-RPC.
//!
//! # What this module does not do
//!
//! It does not implement [`a2a_server::AgentExecutor`] or
//! [`a2a_server::RequestHandler`]. Both return `futures::stream::BoxStream`,
//! and `futures` is not a dependency of this crate — the trait cannot be named,
//! let alone implemented. [`A2aExecutor`] is that role written as ordinary
//! async methods; wiring it into `DefaultRequestHandler` is a one-line adapter
//! per method on the day `futures` is added to `Cargo.toml`, which is a file
//! this unit does not own. [`PgTaskStore`] *does* implement
//! [`a2a_server::TaskStore`], which is stream-free, so the SDK's handler can
//! use it today.
