//! Le carnet: the port an employee's work board is reached through, and the
//! one adapter behind it today.
//!
//! # Why this is a port and not free functions on `agentos_store::backlog`
//!
//! Because of what the customer is being sold. A company that already runs on
//! Jira must be able to point its employees at *its* board, and a company that
//! runs on nothing must get one from us — and the difference between those two
//! must be **a connection setting, not a different product**. An employee says
//! "put this on the board"; where it lands is somebody else's decision, taken
//! once, out of its sight.
//!
//! That only stays true if the internal tool was built behind the seam from the
//! start. A `store::backlog::post` called directly from a turn is a call site
//! that has to be found and rewritten the day a tenant connects Jira, and by
//! then there are several. So: one trait, one adapter today, the same shape
//! `EmailProvider`, `LeadSink` and [`McpCaller`](crate::effects::McpCaller)
//! already have in this workspace.
//!
//! [`McpCaller`](crate::effects::McpCaller) is the precedent this follows most
//! closely, and for its exact reason: its adapter cannot live in
//! `agentos-providers` either, because it needs things a provider adapter may
//! not see. Here it is [`agentos_store`] — a provider crate speaks HTTP and
//! never SQL — and the day the second adapter is an MCP client the two will sit
//! on either side of this trait, which is the point of writing it now.
//!
//! # What this port requires of every adapter, and why it is a type
//!
//! **Everything it hands back is [`Untrusted`].** That is the whole of the
//! obligation, it is unconditional, and there is deliberately nothing for an
//! adapter to *declare*.
//!
//! `EmailProvider` needed a declaration — `opt_outs`, required, with no default
//! and no value meaning "not wired" — because "where do this vendor's
//! unsubscribes arrive" is a fact about a vendor that no type can express, so
//! the only way to make silence unwritable was a required method returning an
//! enum with no cheap variant.
//!
//! "Who wrote this text" is not like that: this workspace already has a type for
//! it, and [`Untrusted<T>`] deliberately implements neither `Display` nor
//! `Deref` nor `AsRef<str>`, so there is no ergonomic path from an item's title
//! into a prompt at all. Putting the obligation in the return type rather than
//! in a declaration is strictly stronger than `opt_outs` is, because there is no
//! convenient value to write: an adapter cannot claim its board is trustworthy,
//! since the trait gives it nowhere to say so.
//!
//! And it must stay that way. A `trusted()` declaration would be a field that
//! **widens** — an adapter author under deadline writes the convenient value,
//! and a customer's Jira service desk, which anybody with a portal login can
//! file into, becomes a channel that writes instructions straight into an
//! employee's brief. The one adapter here is our own table, and it wrapped from
//! the first day — when its only writer was an operator holding an API key and
//! the wrapper looked like ceremony. **That second writer now exists**
//! ([`Effects::post_work`](crate::effects::Effects::post_work)), so an
//! employee's own words reach a colleague's brief through here, and the wrapper
//! was already where it needed to be rather than being a change somebody had to
//! remember. That is the whole of what writing it early bought, and it is worth
//! saying now that the bill has arrived.
//!
//! The price is real and is named where it is paid, in
//! `apps/server/src/loops/initiative.rs`: a turn shown its board is an untrusted
//! turn, and an untrusted turn is not offered the high-risk schemas.
//!
//! # What this port deliberately does not carry
//!
//! **The founder's ordering, and who an item is assigned to.** Those are
//! `PUT /v1/work/{id}` writing our own table, and they are not trait methods,
//! because a company on Jira ranks and assigns *in Jira*. A port method for it
//! would be a verb every future adapter has to fake against a system that has
//! its own answer — and the fake would be a second, losing ranking beside the
//! customer's real one.
//!
//! **An idempotency key on [`Backlog::post`].** `EmailProvider::send` and
//! `LeadSink::stage` carry one because a retry there mails a stranger twice.
//! A retried post is a duplicate line on a board a human reads, and the one
//! caller today is behind `apps/server`'s `replay_idempotent` layer already, so
//! a key here would be a second lock on a door that has one. Add it when an
//! adapter's own writes are not idempotent and the caller is not a request.
