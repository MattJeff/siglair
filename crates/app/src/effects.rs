//! The only code in the workspace that calls a provider, and the only way to
//! call one is to hand it an [`Authorized`] token.
//!
//! # Why the provider handles are private
//!
//! [`Effects`] owns the email, telephony, browser, MCP and payment handles as
//! private fields and exposes exactly one method per effect. There is no
//! accessor, no `Deref`, and no method that takes a bare [`Action`]. So "an
//! employee sent an email without a policy decision" is not a bug review has to
//! catch — it is a program that does not compile, and
//! `tests/ui/effects_bare_action.rs` is that claim checked by rustc.
//!
//! # Why each method takes its own subject type
//!
//! `Authorized<A>` is generic, so a plain `Authorized<Action>` would let a
//! token minted for an email be spent on [`Effects::pay`] — the gate ruled, and
//! it ruled on something else. The subjects below ([`EmailSend`], [`SmsSend`],
//! …) are one type per effect, and each method is bound to exactly one of them
//! via [`Subject`]. The token's *type* therefore says which effect was
//! authorised, and the counterparty inside it is the counterparty the provider
//! is given: [`Effects::send_email`] reads `to` off the token and never off the
//! body, so a rendered message cannot be re-addressed after the ruling.
//!
//! Both trust flavours reach the same method: `Authorized<EmailSend>` for an
//! operator's request and `Authorized<Untrusted<EmailSend>>` for a draft the
//! model wrote after reading a stranger's email. They are different types all
//! the way through the gate — which is what makes `evaluate` refuse the
//! high-risk ones — and converge only here, where the effect is finally
//! performed.
//!
//! # What gets recorded
//!
//! Every attempt writes one `provider_call_attempted` audit row carrying the
//! token's [`DecisionId`](agentos_domain::ids::DecisionId) — success and
//! failure alike. A trail that only records successes cannot answer "we
//! authorised this payment, did it go out?", which is the question an incident
//! starts with. Provider failures are *classified*
//! ([`ProviderError::is_retryable`]) and returned, never swallowed.
//!
//! # The reservation
//!
//! A payment token carries the spend reservation the gate took. This module is
//! the executor the gate's docs refer to: it settles on success and releases on
//! failure, in the same transaction as the audit row, so headroom is never held
//! by a payment that did not happen.

    ///    is an untrusted turn and is offered no high-risk schema. So a
    ///    supplier's sentence relayed through the board arrives as quoted
    ///    material — the same landing a tainted `message_colleague` gets, minus
    ///    the wake. One hop launders nothing.
    /// 2. **A woken colleague or a spent budget — no**, and this half of the
    ///    founder's argument is a claim about the mechanism rather than about
    ///    the writer, so it survives the change intact. `open_for` is read at
    ///    the top of a turn the cadence had already scheduled.
    /// 3. **Flooding — yes, and it is the only thing that changes.** There is no
    ///    ceiling on `work_items` anywhere, and an employee that could file for
    ///    anyone could bury anyone. That is what
    ///    [`inbound::may_assign`] bounds, and it bounds it with the org chart
    ///    rather than with a number nobody has: the set of people whose day this
    ///    employee may fill is the set it may already order about — and an order
    ///    spends their turns, which is strictly worse than a line on a board.
    ///    **The new verb is weaker than one the employee already had, against
    ///    exactly the same people.** Nothing widens.
    ///
    /// So: still not an action. Inventing `ActionKind::WorkItemPost` would put a
    /// discriminant in [`ActionKind::ALL`](agentos_domain::action::ActionKind),
    /// a row in every role pack's partition and an arm in

    /// refuses for a briefing.

    /// no `_` arm: a fifth variant has to be classified by whoever adds it.
    ///
    /// * [`ProviderError::Terminal`] and [`ProviderError::RateLimited`] are
    ///   **answers**. The provider read the request and declined; nothing was
    ///   sent, and the row is settled `failed` so it stops asking for attention.
    /// * [`ProviderError::Retryable`] is the arm worth reading twice, because
    ///   the obvious sentence about it is the wrong way round. It is **not**
    ///   mostly "the request may even have landed". Every adapter in
    ///   `agentos-providers` funnels its entire transport failure set through
    ///   [`ProviderError::timeout`] in one `map_err(|_| …)` around
    ///   `reqwest::send` — `email_resend::call` and `telephony_twilio`'s
    ///   `ApiError::transport` both — so a refused connection, a DNS failure
    ///   and a TLS handshake that never finished all arrive here, and
    ///   [`ProviderError::from_status`] adds 408, 425 and every 5xx on top. In
    ///   every one of those the request either never left this process or was
    ///   turned away without being acted on. The genuinely ambiguous member —
    ///   a read timeout *after* the bytes went out, which is what
    ///   `telephony_twilio` means by *"the request may even have landed"* — is
    ///   one case in that class and not the usual one.
    ///
    ///   Nothing is written and the row stays `in_flight` anyway. That is a
    ///   **pessimistic** answer by construction and not a neutral one: from the
    ///   near side of the socket there is nothing to branch on, so it
    ///   over-reports on purpose. Most rows this leaves behind will be sends
    ///   that never happened, and the reader has to be told that or it will
    ///   read a list of near-misses as a list of double-sends — see
    ///   [`Self::send_sms`], `routes::employees`'s `unsettled_calls`, and
    ///   `docs/OPERATIONS.md` §6. Settling them `failed` instead would be
    ///   pleasant to read and wrong on precisely the row that mattered.
    /// * [`ProviderError::PendingExternal`] is filed with the timeout and not
    ///   with the refusals, deliberately: it means somebody outside must act
    ///   before the resource is usable, it carries no message id, and a send
    ///   cannot produce one at all — so if one ever arrives here, an adapter is
    ///   doing something this method has no honest answer for, and leaving the
    ///   row for a person is the answer that does not invent one.
    ///
    /// It takes the port's own `Result` rather than an [`EffectError`] because
    /// that is what makes the match total: by the time an error has been widened
    /// to `EffectError` the refusals this method must not settle — including
    /// [`Self::begin_send`]'s own — are indistinguishable from the provider's.
    ///
    /// `extra` is what the caller knows and no provider ever said — the payee,
    /// the memo and the amount of a payment. It is merged with, rather than
