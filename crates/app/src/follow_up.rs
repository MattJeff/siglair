//! La relance : a prospect who did not answer is written to again, without
//! anybody remembering to.
//!
//! That is the one thing a company pays a sequencer (Smartlead, Lemlist) for,
//! and everything it needs was already here. An employee can promise an hour
//! and be woken by it ([`crate::calendar`], `0063`); a reply has exactly one
//! door in (`inbound::land`); the gate already refuses a suppressed address
//! and already knows a contact it has written to before is not a new one. What
//! was missing was the reflex, and a reflex is a rule rather than an
//! intention — so it is code on the send path and not a sentence in the brief
//! asking the model to please remember.
//!
//! # The three statements, and where each one runs
//!
//! * **[`sent`] + [`schedule`]** — from [`Effects::chase`](crate::effects::Effects::chase),
//!   in one transaction, right after a `send_email` to somebody outside the
//!   company came back with a provider id. The send is recorded on its thread
//!   as an outbound `messages` row (the same thread a reply will land on, by
//!   `inbound::conversation_for`'s key), and a promise is booked
//!   [`FOLLOW_UP_AFTER`] out with the thread on it (`0082`).
//! * **`calendar::cancel_for_conversation`** — from `inbound::land`, in the
//!   transaction that lands a reply. The promise is settled in `0068`'s
//!   spelling and the employee is not woken for it.
//! * **[`brief`]** — from `loops::initiative`, when the promise rings: the turn
//!   is told, in our voice, that this hour is a follow-up and how long the
//!   silence has been. The model then proposes an ordinary `send_email`, which
//!   goes through the gate like any other — a suppression that arrived in the
//!   meantime refuses it there, and the contact reads as
//!   `ContactStanding::Known`, so the day's stranger budget is not charged a
//!   second time for the same person.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! **No table and no verb.** The promise is an `appointments` row and the
//! chase is a `send_email` the model writes; the only schema change is the
//! column that lets a reply find the promise. **No text of theirs.** The
//! subject line is our word and a masked address, and the brief carries a
//! date; the address the model needs is inside the frame the wake already
//! shows it.
//!
//! # The vertical's own chase, and which of the two survives
//!
//! `crate::vertical` chases too, and not through here: `selling_turn` and
//! `chasing_turn` write `contacts.next_follow_up_at = now + FOLLOW_UP_AFTER`
//! through `store::revenue::mark_contacted`, `due_chase` reads the column back
//! through `contacts_due_for_follow_up`, and the chase is `chase_message`
//! through `Seller::touch` — no model, no wake. Two mechanisms for "write
//! again in three days if nothing comes back", disjoint by construction: a
//! turn's `send_email` books a promise and writes no column; the vertical's
//! sender writes the column and books no promise; so no thread ever holds
//! both, and `inbound::land` settles both in the transaction that lands the
//! reply (`cancel_for_conversation` beside `stop_follow_up`). They do not
//! contradict each other today. They would the day somebody wires
//! [`Effects::chase`](crate::effects::Effects::chase) into `Seller::touch`
//! without also silencing `due_chase`: two chases on day three, one by the
//! wake and one by the queue.
//!
//! **Decision: the promise is the source of truth, and the column goes.** The
//! promise is what a reply cancels in the landing transaction, what the
//! ceiling is counted against off the thread's own rows, and what wakes the
//! seat with the thread in hand; the column is a date on a contact that a
//! queue polls. When the vertical's chase moves, it moves here — `Seller::touch`
//! records its send with [`sent`] and books with [`schedule`] under an
//! `AppointmentBook` the gate ruled on, `due_chase` stops reading the column,
//! and `next_follow_up_at` is written by nobody. **Not done in the wave that
//! wrote this paragraph, on purpose**, because the column is not one reader:
//! `due_chase` is driven by `loops::initiative::sales_work_for` and by the
//! eval's dry run, whose digest is frozen and whose chase branch would change
//! outcome; `store::revenue::queueable` reads it for `routes::queue`;
//! `0011_revenue.sql` clears it by trigger on an opt-out and indexes it;
//! `prospects::import` and `queue::record_queued` write it. Silencing
//! `due_chase` alone would leave a queue that never fires behind a route and
//! an eval that still ask it, and wiring `chase` alone would chase twice.
//! Until the move, the rule is the one above: **a send is chased by exactly one
//! of the two, chosen by which sender made it, and `Effects::chase` is called
//! from `Turn::perform` only.**
