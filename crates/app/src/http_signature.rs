//! RFC 9421 HTTP Message Signatures, Ed25519, over the JWKS this deployment
//! already publishes.
//!
//! # Why this format and not a header of our own
//!
//! A bespoke `X-Fabrikam-Signature: <base64>` is about forty lines and works
//! this afternoon. It is also a format with exactly one implementation, which
//! means every counterparty who wants to verify us has to be told what to hash,
//! in what order, with which encoding — and told again the first time somebody
//! adds a header to the covered set. That conversation is the cost, and it is
//! paid once per counterparty, forever.
//!
//! RFC 9421 is the same forty lines plus a canonicalisation nobody has to
//! explain, and it is what actually shipped: Cloudflare's Web Bot Auth signs
//! with RFC 9421 over Ed25519 and publishes a JWKS at
//! [`DIRECTORY_PATH`](agentos_domain::identity::DIRECTORY_PATH), which is the
//! endpoint `routes::well_known` already serves, at that path, with that media
//! type. The previous wave chose this before this module existed —
//! `agentos_providers::signing::Signature::to_base64` documents itself as "the
//! RFC 8941 byte-sequence encoding RFC 9421 puts inside a `Signature:` header"
//! — so the honest description of this file is that it finishes a decision, not
//! that it makes one.
//!
//! What that buys concretely: a peer running Cloudflare's verifier, or any of
//! the `http-message-signatures` libraries, verifies us with configuration
//! rather than code.
//!
//! # No dependency was added for it
//!
//! ponytail: the signature base is a canonical string, and building it is
//! `format!`. There is no RFC 9421 crate in `Cargo.lock` and pulling one in for
//! string concatenation plus a `sha2` call — both already here — would be the
//! most expensive way to write [`base`]. The day this needs the full component
//! grammar (structured-field parameters, `@request-response`, byte-sequence
//! headers) is the day to reach for one.
//!
//! # The profile
//!
//! One signature, labelled [`LABEL`], covering:
//!
//! ```text
//! ("@method" "@authority" "@path" "@query" "content-digest")
//! ```
//!
//! `content-digest` is what makes the body covered — RFC 9421 signs headers,
//! not bodies, so a signature without it proves only that somebody addressed
//! this URL. [`verify_request`] therefore refuses a signature that does not
//! cover it, and refuses one whose `Content-Digest` disagrees with the bytes
//! that arrived. `@query` is covered because our own A2A endpoint carries
//! `?employee=<uuid>`: leaving it out would let a signature for one employee's
//! endpoint be replayed against another's.
//!
//! # What verifying proves, and what it does not
//!
//! It proves **who** sent these bytes and that they are unaltered. It says
//! nothing whatever about whether the content is safe, and a verified peer is
//! still a stranger's agent: everything it sends stays
//! [`Untrusted`](agentos_domain::untrusted::Untrusted). A verified signature is
//! never a reason to unwrap one.
//!
//! ponytail: no replay cache. `created`/`expires` bound the window to
//! [`LIFETIME`], which is the same protection every bearer credential on the
//! wire has and is the property a verifier can check with no state. A nonce
//! table is the upgrade path, and it is worth building the day an idempotent
//! replay actually costs something — for `SendMessage` it appends a duplicate
//! turn, not money.
