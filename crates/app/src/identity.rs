//! Signing in an employee's name: minting its keypair, and spending it.
//!
//! # Is signing an action that needs the Policy Gate? Yes.
//!
//! It has to be, and the reasoning is the one this workspace already made for
//! every other effect. A signature is not a computation, it is an **assertion
//! made in the company's name** — the entire value of it to a counterparty is
//! that Fabrikam stands behind what was signed. That is the same kind of thing
//! as sending an email or moving money, and `effects.rs` says what happens to
//! effects that do not pass the gate: they are side effects that escaped the
//! design, and the type system is supposed to make them unspellable.
//!
//! So [`Identity::sign`] takes an [`Authorized<A>`], whose only constructors
//! are private to `gate.rs`. There is no `sign(&self, payload)`. A caller that
//! wants a signature must first have had the gate rule on the thing it is
//! signing, and a suspended employee cannot obtain a token at all.
//!
//! ## Why it does not get an `Action::Sign` of its own
//!
//! The other half of the decision, and the one that is easy to get wrong.
//! Adding `Action::Sign` would put a *second* ruling in front of every
//! signature, and the gate would be ruling on the wrong question: "may this
//! employee sign?" is never the question anybody has. The question is always
//! "may this employee send this A2A request / this email / this order?" — and
//! once that is answered yes, refusing to sign it would produce an
//! authorised message that nobody can verify, which is worse than either
//! outcome.
//!
//! Worse, a standalone `Action::Sign` is a **signing oracle**. An employee that
//! can obtain a bare signing authorization can sign arbitrary bytes — including
//! bytes that are somebody else's contract — and every one of those signatures
//! is valid against our published key forever. The gate would have approved
//! "signing", not the assertion.
//!
//! So the rule is: **a signature rides the authority of the action it
//! attests.** `Authorized<A2aSend>` signs the A2A request. `Authorized<PaymentCreate>`
//! signs the payment instruction. The token that permitted the assertion is the
//! token that permits putting the company's name on it, the trail links them by
//! [`Authorized::decision_id`], and there is no path to a signature that no
//! ruling stands behind.
//!
//! ## What the trail records
//!
//! One `message_signed` row per signature, carrying the decision id, the `kid`
//! that signed, and the SHA-256 of the payload — not the payload. The digest is
//! what makes the row worth having: given a signature a counterparty disputes,
//! the trail can say whether *this* employee signed *that exact* payload and
//! under which ruling. Storing the payload itself would put outbound message
//! bodies in the audit log forever.
//!
//! # Storage
//!
//! The private key never exists in the database as a key. It is sealed by
//! [`LocalEnvelopeSecretStore`] under the employee's own [`SecretRef`], so the
//! master key protects the data key and the data key protects the seed, with
//! `tenant={id}` and the full ref as the two AADs — a row lifted into another
//! tenant's context fails to authenticate rather than decrypting to our
//! identity. See `agentos_providers::secrets`.
//!
//! ponytail: [`LocalEnvelopeSecretStore`] concrete rather than
//! `Arc<dyn SecretStore>`, and that is deliberate rather than lazy. The
//! `SecretStore` trait is keyed on a `SecretRef` and owns its own rows; here the
//! rows are `employee_signing_keys`, so what is wanted is the *cipher* half of
//! that type — `seal` and `open` — and not its map. Those are exactly the two
//! functions its module docs promise stay signature-compatible when this becomes
//! `kms:Encrypt`/`kms:Decrypt`.
