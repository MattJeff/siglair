//! The MCP client: one bound server, its tools, and the risk class of each.
//!
//! A concrete struct, not a trait. There is exactly one MCP implementation and
//! there will only ever be one — the protocol *is* the abstraction, and a
//! `trait McpClient` with a single impl would only be a second place to keep
//! in sync.
//!
//! # The two things this module exists to prevent
//!
//! **1. Server-side request forgery.** An agent that can name a URL can name
//! `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/`, and
//! then the "MCP server" it just connected to is your cloud instance metadata
//! endpoint handing out role credentials. So the check happens at
//! [`McpServer::bind`] — once, when an *operator* configures a server — and
//! never at call time. [`Action::McpCall`] carries a [`McpTool`] (a server
//! handle and a tool handle, both [`Slug`]s), never a URL, so there is no
//! call-time string for a model to steer. Binding resolves the host, refuses
//! every address that is not globally routable, and records the addresses it
//! resolved to.
//!
//! **2. A tool call turning into three.** [`rmcp`] offers `call_tool`, which
//! silently drives SEP-2322 multi-round rounds: the server answers "I need
//! more input", the client answers it, and the extra exchanges happen *behind
//! the Policy Gate's back* — the gate ruled on one call and got several. This
//! module uses `call_tool_once` and treats "another round required" as a
//! refusal. One authorization, one round trip.
//!
//! # There is one transport, it is HTTP, and there will not be a second
//!
//! MCP defines two transports. This module implements one of them, and the
//! omission is a decision rather than a gap, so it is argued here — the day
//! somebody wants to talk to a stdio server, this is the paragraph they have to
//! beat.
//!
//! **What was asked for.** Every MCP server people actually ship is a stdio
//! server: a command, spawned as a child process, JSON-RPC over its pipes. The
//! real Orizn visa server is `npx -y orizn-visa-mcp`, and it is the exact case
//! this product exists to serve. Adding
//! `rmcp::transport::TokioChildProcess` next to
//! [`StreamableHttpClientTransport`] is about fifteen lines.
//!
//! **Why those fifteen lines are not here.** A binding is a row in
//! `mcp_servers`, written through `apps/server/src/routes/mcp.rs` by anyone
//! holding a tenant API key (migration 0019). A stdio transport turns that row's
//! payload from a URL into a **command line**, and the two are not variations on
//! a theme:
//!
//! * A URL is checked by `resolve_and_vet`. There is a real, closed, checkable
//!   property — "does this resolve somewhere globally routable" — and
//!   `placement` is that property, written down. A command has no analogous
//!   property. `sh`, `node -e`, `python -c` and `/proc/self/exe` are all
//!   "a program", and an allowlist of permitted programs *is* the configuration,
//!   which makes the tenant-supplied command redundant.
//! * A URL reaches a process somebody else runs. A spawned command runs **as the
//!   server**, in the server's process tree, with the server's environment —
//!   which holds `DATABASE_URL`, the AES key `crate::secrets` decrypts every
//!   tenant's credentials with, and every provider token in the deployment. The
//!   SSRF defence above exists to stop an agent reading the cloud metadata
//!   endpoint; a child process does not need the metadata endpoint, because it
//!   already has `/proc/self/environ`.
//! * None of the machinery below would notice. [`RiskClass`] classes what a tool
//!   *does on the server side*, and `allowed_mcp_tools` names tools by handle.
//!   Both reason about calls. A hostile binding does its work at spawn time,
//!   before any tool is called, and every control in this file rules on calls.
//!   Fail-closed on tool classification is not fail-closed on process creation.
//!
//! So the honest containment for a tenant-configurable stdio transport is a
//! sandbox: a per-tenant container, a scrubbed environment, a read-only root, a
//! seccomp profile, and a resource limit — a piece of infrastructure larger than
//! this crate, and one whose absence would be invisible until the day it
//! mattered. The rule this module already follows is that a control it cannot
//! state is a control it does not have, and it cannot state that one.
//!
//! **The two shapes that were rejected, and why HTTP-only beat them.**
//!
//! *Stdio in the product, contained.* Rejected on the paragraph above: the
//! containment is unbuilt, and shipping the transport first and the sandbox
//! later means shipping remote code execution behind a `CHECK` constraint. The
//! containment is the feature; the transport is the easy part.
//!
//! *An operator-level stdio bridge — a command named in the deployment's config
//! rather than in a tenant's row.* This is the closest call, and it is genuinely
//! safer: the operator already chooses the binary the server runs. But it buys
//! that safety by asserting the operator is trusted, which is the same assertion
//! HTTP-only makes with **no new code, no second configuration surface, and no
//! second class of binding** for `Fleet` to route between. It would also fork
//! this file's one clean sentence — *a binding is a URL, checked at bind time* —
//! into two sentences with different security properties, and the second one
//! would be the one nobody re-reads. An operator who wants a local stdio server
//! can already have one, by running it and pointing a `private` binding at it,
//! which is what [`Reach::Private`] is for and is why it exists.
//!
//! **A server that already speaks Streamable HTTP needs none of this.** Bind its
//! URL and stop; that is the ordinary case and it is the whole of what this
//! module was built for. Orizn's own data is reachable that way — the MCP
//! endpoint under `visa.orizn.app` answers `tools/list` and `tools/call` over
//! HTTP directly — so the tenant this workspace exists to serve does not need a
//! bridge at all. Do not read the paragraph below as the Orizn path; it is not.
//!
//! **What the operator has to run for a server that speaks only stdio.** One
//! process per such server, in front of it, translating to Streamable HTTP. This
//! is the general mechanism and it is the reason the decision above cost
//! nothing: refusing stdio *in the product* does not refuse stdio *servers*, it
//! moves the containment to where the operator already has it. Off the shelf:
//!
//! ```text
//! npx -y supergateway --stdio "<the server's own command>" \
//!     --outputTransport streamableHttp --port 8931 --streamableHttpPath /mcp
//! ```
//!
//! and then a binding at `http://127.0.0.1:8931/mcp` with `reach = 'private'`.
//! That is a sidecar — the case [`Reach::Private`] was written for — and it is
//! how `crates/app/tests/orizn.rs` reaches `orizn-visa-mcp`'s **stdio** package,
//! with the same command and no test-only path through this module. That test
//! keeps using the bridge deliberately even though the HTTP endpoint exists,
//! because the bridge is the path every *other* tenant's stdio server will take
//! and it should be exercised by something. Writing our own proxy instead would
//! be re-implementing a JSON-RPC pipe pump in order to avoid depending on one.
//!
//! The containment moves with the process: the bridge runs where the operator
//! puts it, under whatever the operator's platform gives it, and this server
//! keeps talking to a socket. That is the whole argument — not that stdio is
//! bad, but that *spawning* is a different privilege from *dialling*, and this
//! process should only ever do the second one.
//!
//! **Where that argument now stands.** It stands, unchanged, and
//! [`crate::hosted`] is what it invited: the last sentence above is the load
//! bearing one, and the way to serve a customer who cannot run a bridge is not
//! to weaken it but to move the spawning somewhere this process has no
//! privilege at all. A hosted binding is a [`Package`](crate::hosted::Package)
//! this binary names — never a tenant's command line, which is the objection
//! above and is not answered, only avoided — started by a
//! [`BridgeRuntime`](crate::hosted::BridgeRuntime) that is a different process
//! on a different network, and reached from here as a URL like any other. Every
//! control in this file still rules on calls, and now nothing in this file has
//! to rule on process creation, because this process still creates none.
//!
//! # Risk classes are declared, not discovered
//!
//! Every discovered tool gets a [`RiskClass`]. It comes from the operator's
//! declaration, because the alternative — the server's own `annotations` —
//! is written by the thing we are defending against. The MCP specification
//! says so itself: *"Clients should never make tool use decisions based on
//! ToolAnnotations received from untrusted servers."* So a server's hints can
//! only make a tool **more** dangerous than declared, never less, and a tool
//! nobody declared is [`RiskClass::Destructive`] — which needs a human.
//!
//! # What comes back is untrusted
//!
//! A tool result is text a third party wrote. It leaves this module as an
//! [`Untrusted<CallToolResult>`] so it cannot be spliced into a prompt without
//! a call site that greps.
//!
//! # Where a binding comes from, and what the model is told about it
//!
//! [`Fleet`] is this module's production entry point: it reads one tenant's
//! `mcp_servers` / `mcp_tool_declarations` rows (migration 0013), binds each
//! one, and is the [`McpCaller`] behind
//! [`Effects::call_tool`](crate::effects::Effects::call_tool).
//!
//! Those rows come from `apps/server/src/routes/mcp.rs`, which is the operator's
//! door and the only writer. Two things about it are load-bearing here and are
//! not this module's to enforce: a [`Declaration::digest`] is only ever accepted
//! against a digest the server is serving *at that moment*, so a pin cannot be
//! invented by someone who has not looked; and [`Fleet::bind`] is called from a
//! background loop rather than from a request, because it resolves DNS and opens
//! a connection. [`Fleet::failures`] is what that loop reports back — a server
//! that will not bind is dropped from the fleet on purpose, and a drop nobody
//! can see is a drop nobody can fix.
//!
//! [`Fleet::inventory`] is the other half, and it is the half that was missing:
//! the turn loop offers ONE `call_mcp_tool` schema for every MCP tool on every
//! server (see [`crate::turn`] for why that stays), so without a list of names
//! the model can only guess one and the gate denies the guess. The inventory is
//! that list, and it is deliberately narrow:
//!
//! * **Only tools the operator declared.** A tool nobody declared is named by
//!   the server and by nobody else, and [`crate::prompt`] exists to keep a
//!   counterparty's text out of the cached prefix. An undeclared tool is still
//!   bound and still callable by exact name — it is just not something a
//!   hostile server gets to write into a system prompt.
//! * **Names only, never descriptions.** [`BoundTool::description`] is the
//!   server's own prose, which is why it is an [`Untrusted<String>`]. It is for
//!   a human reading an approval, not for the prefix.
//! * **Filtered by the turn's trust label**, by
//!   [`SystemPrompt::render`](crate::prompt::SystemPrompt::render), on the same
//!   axis and through the same predicate as the tool schemas —
//!   [`crate::turn::visible`].
//! * **Narrowed to what the employee may call**, by
//!   [`SystemPrompt::with_mcp_tools`](crate::prompt::SystemPrompt::with_mcp_tools),
//!   through the policy allowlist the gate rules with. This is a *tenant's*
//!   inventory: an employee is one seat in it, and telling every seat about
//!   every server is both a token bill that grows with the company's
//!   integrations and an invitation to spend turns being denied.

/// which is an `agentos-app` type, and never names a provider.
///
/// The layering is not the only thing it buys, and the second thing is bigger.
/// **A plaintext credential never crosses the crate boundary in either
/// direction.** The HTTP layer hands a `String` in ([`seal`](Self::seal),
/// which takes it by value) and hands sealed bytes back in
/// ([`bind`](Self::bind)); there is no signature here that returns a
/// [`Secret`], so "the token is never in a response, a log or an error" is a
/// property of the API rather than a discipline in four handlers.
///
/// # And it makes the connect path bind the way the loop binds
///
/// [`bind`](Self::bind) takes the **sealed** form, so the route that verifies a
/// brand-new credential seals it first and binds from the ciphertext — exactly

/// `rmcp` knows how to answer this — `DynamicTransportError::is_authorization_
/// required` is the same walk — but keeps it `pub(crate)`, and the transport
/// error it wraps is generic over `reqwest::Error`, which this crate may not
/// name. What *is* public is the cause: [`AuthRequiredError`] and
/// [`InsufficientScopeError`] are plain structs on the source chain, so
/// downcasting for them costs six lines and no dependency.
///
/// The codes are [`ProviderError::from_status`]'s own, so a refused MCP
/// credential reads in an audit row exactly like a refused HTTP one — one
/// vocabulary for "the far side would not take this token", not two.
///
/// # The hole beside it: a server that answers `402 Payment Required`
///
/// This walk recognises two causes and everything else falls to
/// [`ProviderError::timeout`] in the caller, i.e. **retryable**. That is right
/// for a socket that died mid-send, which is the other thing
/// [`ServiceError::TransportSend`] means, and it is wrong for every status
/// `rmcp` does not lift into a named error — including `402`, which reaches
/// `response.error_for_status()?` and arrives here as an opaque client error.
/// So an MCP server that starts charging per call is asked again, inside the
/// turn, until `Budgets::max_tool_calls` runs out, and the audit row says
/// `retryable: true` about a refusal that is not going to change. It is the
/// exact failure this function's own docs describe for a revoked credential,
/// one status along.
///
/// **It is not fixed here, and the reason is a version.** The fix is to read
/// the status off the error and hand it to [`ProviderError::from_status`] —
/// this workspace's one rule for classifying an HTTP response, which already
/// names `402` as `payment_required`. Reading it means downcasting to
/// `reqwest::Error`, and `rmcp` 3.1.4 is built against **reqwest 0.13** while
/// this workspace is on **0.12**: two distinct crates to the compiler, so the
/// downcast cannot match and `Any` cannot be made to lie about it. Naming both
/// versions in this crate to close it would leave `mcp.rs` and `peer_keys.rs`
/// each using a different `reqwest::Client`, which is a worse bug than the one
/// being fixed. The day the two agree, this function becomes
/// `err.downcast_ref::<reqwest::Error>().and_then(reqwest::Error::status)`
/// followed by `from_status`, the two arms below fold into it unchanged, and
/// this paragraph goes away.
///
/// Nothing downstream is waiting on that. `agentos_app::x402` argues that
/// paying a 402 is an `Action::PaymentCreate` the Policy Gate rules on, which
/// means the payment starts from a demand a human has looked at — not from a
