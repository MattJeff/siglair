//! Connecting a tenant's own model, proving it, and handing the proof to a turn.
//!
//! `crates/domain/src/model_access.rs` argues why the connection is a tenant
//! resource and not a policy field; `migrations/0041_tenant_model_access.sql`
//! argues the table and `migrations/0050_tenant_model_key.sql` the credential
//! column. This module is the only place any of them meets a network, and it
//! makes five decisions.
//!
//! # 0. The credential is a column on the row it proves
//!
//! `migrations/0050_tenant_model_key.sql` is the argument in full; the part that
//! belongs here is what it changed about this module. Until 0050 the key went to
//! an `agentos_providers::secrets::SecretStore` and the row went to Postgres,
//! and the only `SecretStore` this deployment ever wires is
//! `MemorySecretStore` — a `HashMap` in the server process. So the two halves of
//! a connection had different lifetimes, and every restart produced the state
//! the sentence below promises is unreachable: a row saying "connected" and a
//! credential that was not there. Worse, it produced it *expensively*, because
//! [`connected`] reads the row and `reserve_a_turn` commits before anything
//! looks for the key.
//!
//! Now the sealed credential is `tenant_model_access.sealed_key`, written by the
//! same INSERT as the proof and read by the same SELECT, under AAD
//! `model://<tenant>` — the shape `0040_mcp_credentials` established for MCP
//! bearer tokens and `crates/app/src/mcp.rs`'s [`Credentials`] already
//! implements. This module builds no cipher of its own and stores nothing
//! anywhere else.
//!
//! # 1. Prove first, store second. Never the other way round.
//!
//! [`connect`] runs the verification call **before** the credential is sealed
//! into the row, and writes nothing at all unless the call returned a
//! completion. So a stored key is always a key that answered, and there is no
//! state where the row says "connected" and the credential does not work.
//!
//! Since 0050 that is a property of the schema rather than of this function's
//! ordering: the CHECK constraint makes `path = 'api_key'` and a present
//! `sealed_key` a biconditional, so the half-written state cannot be spelled in
//! SQL at all, by this function or by anything else.
//!
//! The alternative — store, then verify, then mark — buys one thing (the user
//! does not re-paste a key that failed for a transient reason) and costs the
//! guarantee. It also creates the exact failure this feature exists to move off
//! go-live: a credential that looks connected in the setup flow and 400s at the
//! first employee turn a week later.
//!
//! # 2. The proof is a real turn, through the real adapter
//!
//! [`probe`] is one [`Llm::complete`] with `max_tokens: 1`, no system prompt and
//! no tools. Not a `GET /v1/models` — that endpoint is free and it was the
//! obvious cheap answer, and it is the wrong one, because it proves
//! *authentication* and not *inference*. A key on an account with an empty
//! credit balance lists models happily and refuses to complete anything, which
//! is precisely the failure that would then land at go-live. The whole reason
//! verification moved to connect time is that the setup flow is where a person
//! can still fix it.
//!
//! Going through [`Llm`] rather than a bespoke request has a second consequence
//! worth stating: the CLI path is verified by the same function and the same
//! call, so "connected" means the same verb on both paths even though it does
//! not mean the same promise — see [`probe`]'s own docs.
//!
//! **What that call costs, and who pays it.** It is a handful of input tokens
//! and one output token. Against `agentos_eval::cost::rate_card`, on the most
//! expensive model this build can name, that is under two hundredths of a US
//! cent — call it $0.0002 and round up. It is billed to the credential being
//! verified, which is the point rather than a side effect: the first model call
//! this system ever makes on a tenant's behalf is already on the tenant's bill,
//! before a single employee exists. It is also the **only** model call in the
//! whole entry path — `crates/store/src/provisioning.rs` knows three steps,
//! `Email`, `Phone` and `Whatsapp`, none of which is a model, and the first turn
//! is the next one.
//!
//! # 3. A verdict is a closed enum, and a failure stores nothing
//!
//! Every non-success verdict returns the key to the caller's stack to be
//! dropped, writes no row, and appends no audit line. `Verdict::explain` is
//! ours, fixed, and contains none of the provider's own text — a verification
//! response is the one place in this system where a credential and an error body
//! have been in the same function.
//!
//! # 4. The tenant's key is what pays for the tenant's turns
//!
//! [`for_turn`] resolves the row into the [`Llm`] a turn actually runs on:
//! [`ModelPath::ApiKey`] builds an `AnthropicLlm` around the stored credential,
//! [`ModelPath::Cli`] hands back the host's own backend. **No row means no
//! turn** — [`NoModel::NotConnected`], which the two turn sites in `apps/server`
//! render as the same named, non-retryable refusal an empty `allowed_models`
//! already produces.
//!
//! What it deliberately does **not** do is choose the model. That is still
//! `agentos_domain::policy::model_for` over the four intersected layers, and it
//! is unchanged: a tenant who connects a key for Opus under a policy that
//! permits only Haiku runs Haiku. `a_connected_key_cannot_widen_the_allowlist`
//! is what says so.

///
/// On [`ModelPath::Cli`] it means considerably less, and the honest list is
/// short: **a `claude` binary on this host answered a prompt.** It does not mean
///
/// * …that the model that answered is the model asked for. `llm_cli` passes
///   `--model`, and the session, the subscription and the plan can all override
///   it. The adapter's own header records a day when 7 of 7 completed turns came
///   back in French because of a setting on the operator's laptop.
/// * …that tool calls will arrive. The CLI exposes no structured `tool_use`, so
///   `llm_cli::bridge_tool_call` re-inflates JSON out of prose. That shim's own
///   documented measurement is 8 of 23 calls with the wrong argument shape.
/// * …anything about cost. `cache_read_tokens` from that backend is dominated by
///   Claude Code's own system prompt, so `model_usage_daily` records a number
///   that is about the CLI and not about the employee. `0024_model_usage.sql`
