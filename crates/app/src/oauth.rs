//! The authorization code flow, so connecting a connector is a click.
//!
//! # What this unlocks, and why it is the only thing that was in the way
//!
//! [`crate::catalog`] can name exactly one connector today, and its own docs say
//! why: GitHub's remote MCP server takes a personal access token, and every
//! other one worth connecting — Notion, Linear, Sentry, Atlassian, Stripe,
//! Cloudflare, anything of Google's — takes OAuth. The MCP client was never the
//! limit. `McpServer::bind` sends `Authorization: Bearer <string>` and does not
//! care where the string came from; what was missing was a way to *obtain* one
//! without asking a customer to go and mint it by hand, which is the step that
//! turns a five-minute onboarding into a support ticket.
//!
//! So this module produces the same string [`crate::mcp::Credentials`] already
//! stores, and everything downstream of the column is untouched. That is the
//! whole shape of the change and it is why it is small.

//!
//! Four secrets, four homes, and mixing any two of them up is the bug this
//! module is arranged to prevent:
//!
//! * **`client_id` / `client_secret` are OURS, per connector.** They identify
//!   *this product* to the provider, not the customer, and one registration
//!   serves every tenant. They live in the deployment's environment
//!   ([`OauthClients::parse`], read by `apps/server/src/config.rs`), never in a
//!   table and never in a tenant's row. Putting them in the database would mean
//!   a tenant-scoped copy of a deployment-scoped fact, and the first customer to
//!   edit theirs would be impersonating our application.
//! * **The `code_verifier` is per flow.** Sealed into `mcp_oauth_flows`, opened
//!   once, and gone with the row.
//! * **The access token and the refresh token are the TENANT's.** Sealed into
//!   `mcp_servers` under an AAD that names the tenant and the server handle,
//!   exactly like a pasted bearer, because after the exchange that is all it is.
//! * **The `state` is a capability**, not an identifier. Whoever holds it can
//!   finish somebody's flow. It exists inside [`Started::authorize_url`] and in
//!   the browser's address bar, and it is stored only as a SHA-256 — see below.
//!
//! # What binds a public callback to a tenant
//!
//! The callback route cannot carry an API key: the provider's redirect is a
//! browser navigation and the browser has no key. So the only thing that says
//! which tenant a `code` belongs to is the `state` parameter, and it has to
//! carry that weight alone.
//!
//! * **Unguessable.** [`STATE_BYTES`] straight from the operating system's
//!   entropy source, base64url. 256 bits.
//! * **Ours.** The tenant is read out of the row `start` wrote. It is never in
//!   the query string, never in the redirect URI, and never derived from
//!   anything the browser sent — the same sentence
//!   `routes::webhooks::Endpoint::tenant_id` carries, for the same reason.
//! * **Single use.** The row is claimed with one `UPDATE … WHERE consumed_at IS
//!   NULL … RETURNING`, which is atomic, so two callbacks racing on one state
//!   produce one winner and one 404. That transaction commits *before* the token
//!   exchange, so even a crash mid-exchange cannot leave a replayable state.
//! * **Short lived.** [`FLOW_TTL`]. A consent page a customer left open over
//!   lunch is a state sitting in a browser history.
//! * **Not recoverable from the database.** The column is `sha256(state)`, so
//!   read access to `mcp_oauth_flows` does not let anybody complete a flow. It
//!   is a lookup key, not a bearer token at rest, and the two are stored
//!   differently for the same reason a password is.
//!
//! Take `state` away and the route would have to take a tenant id from the query
//! string. Then anyone on the internet could send their own provider `code` to
//! `?tenant=<somebody else>` and attach *their* account to *that* company's
//! employees — every task the tenant runs through that connector executing in an
//! attacker's workspace, and every result read back out of it. That is the
//! mutation, and it is written down in this module's tests.
//!
//! # PKCE, and what it defends that `state` does not
//!
//! `state` proves the callback belongs to a flow we started. It says nothing
//! about who is *presenting* the code. An authorization code travels in a URL:
//! through the browser's address bar and history, through any `Referer` a page on
//! the redirect origin sends, through proxy and CDN logs, and — for the flows
//! that ever touch a native app — through whatever else registered the redirect
//! scheme. A code that leaks any of those ways is redeemable by whoever picked it
//! up, once, and once is enough.
//!
//! PKCE closes it: the consent request commits to `S256(verifier)`, the token
//! request has to present the `verifier`, and the verifier is in our database
//! and never in a browser. An intercepted code is then worth nothing.
//!
//! `S256` and never `plain`: `plain` puts the verifier in the authorize URL,
//! which is precisely the place we are assuming leaks, so it defends nothing
//! while looking like it does. There is no branch here that can select it.
//!
//! # Refreshing, on the clock that already exists
//!
//! An access token expires; a refresh token does not. Something has to swap one
//! for the other *before* an employee needs it, because an employee that waits
//! for a token exchange is an employee that waits.
//!
//! There is already a loop rebinding every tenant's fleet every five minutes —
//! `apps/server/src/routes/mcp.rs`'s binder — and [`refresh_due`] is a step
//! inside it, not a second timer. That matters more than it sounds: two clocks
//! over one table is how a token gets refreshed by one task while another is
//! binding with the copy it read a moment ago, and the failure is a 401 nobody
//! can reproduce. One loop, one order: refresh what is due, commit, then bind.
//!
//! [`REFRESH_MARGIN`] is deliberately several ticks wide, so a token is offered
//! for refresh three or four times before it could possibly expire and a single
//! failed attempt is not an outage.

/// [`reached_the_server`](crate::mcp): retrying hammers a third party with a
/// dead credential and hides a broken binding behind a status that reads like
/// progress. It is also the kind of traffic that gets an OAuth client
/// suspended.
///
/// So a [`REJECTED`] refresh clears `sealed_refresh_token`, and that is the
/// whole park: `SELECT_DUE` requires the column to be NOT NULL, and
/// `0042_mcp_oauth` already gives NULL a meaning — "this binding cannot outlive
/// its access token" — because some providers issue no refresh token at all. The
/// binding keeps the access token it has, works until that expires, and then
/// surfaces as an ordinary bind failure on the page an operator already reads.
/// **No new notification, no new table, no new column**: re-consenting is a
/// human's decision, which is the sentence [`due`] was written under.
///
/// Only [`REJECTED`] parks. `unreachable` (the connection failed, or the status
/// was a 429/5xx), `too_large`, `unparseable` and `no_access_token` all keep
/// their token and their retries — a provider having a bad minute must not cost
/// a customer a trip back through a consent screen.
///
/// The tenant is `tx`'s, because row-level security honours nothing else. The
/// caller commits — this writes, which is why it cannot share the read-only
/// transaction `Fleet::bind` runs in.
///
/// # `catalog` is a parameter, and it is what makes this loop testable at all
///
/// The lookup below used to be [`catalog::find`], which reads the `const`
/// [`CATALOG`](catalog::CATALOG). Every OAuth entry in it points at somebody
/// else's authorization server through a `&'static str` https literal, so the

/// [`refresh_one`] and then [`park_refresh`] **by hand, in that order**: the
