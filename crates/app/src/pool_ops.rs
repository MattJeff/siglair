//! Pooled phone numbers: the slot an employee occupies, giving it back, and
//! the two questions an operator asks about the pool.
//!
//! # Why a pool
//!
//! `Step::Phone` buys one number per employee. In France that is one regulated
//! bundle per employee — a French address and a proof of address under three
//! months, reviewed by a human — so onboarding a hundred employees means a
//! hundred human reviews. That cost is the same at Twilio, at Telnyx and
//! anywhere else, because it is the regulator's cost and not the vendor's. A
//! tenant that owns five numbers and routes a hundred employees over them pays
//! it five times.
//!
//! So a pooled number is **owned by the tenant**, and an employee is
//! *allocated* onto it. Both models stay: a US number needs no bundle and a
//! dedicated identity is better there. Pooling is a strategy, not a
//! replacement, and both satisfy the same contract — a `phone` resource that is
//! `Ready` with a binding, released idempotently on termination.
//!
//! # The pattern is `Step::Whatsapp`, generalised
//!
//! One verified company WhatsApp sender already carries many employees
//! (`provisioning.rs`, `WHATSAPP_ROUTING`), and its routing address carries the
//! employee id so that two employees on one sender cannot collide on
//! `employee_resources`' unique `(provider, external_id)` index. A pooled slot
//! is spelled the same way, for the same reason, and gains a second one:
//!
//! ```text
//! provider    = "phone-pool"
//! external_id = "+33757590001/018f2c…-employee-uuid"
//! ```
//!
//! **That encoding is what makes releasing a slot safe.** `release_step` hands
//! `external_id` straight to `TelephonyProvider::release`, which is
//! `DELETE IncomingPhoneNumbers/{sid}` — and the one thing this unit must never
//! do is delete a number four colleagues are still working on. A slot's
//! external id is not a sid and can never name one, so the delete cannot
//! resolve; and `ProvisioningEngine::release_step`, which is the path a
//! termination actually takes, short-circuits the provider call entirely for a
//! binding [`is_pooled`] answers for. The number is the tenant's property, and
//! no employee leaving is an instruction to give it back.
//!
//! This module used to carry a second releaser, `release_slot`, saying the same
//! thing one level up. Nothing outside `#[cfg(test)]` ever called it — the
//! engine's own path both frees the `number_allocations` row and clears the
//! binding in one commit, which `release_slot` could not do because it never
//! knew the region — so it is gone rather than kept as a plausible-looking
//! alternative for somebody to wire by mistake.
//!
//! # Where the pool itself is written down
//!
//! In `phone_numbers`, the table `0010_phone_pool.sql` created for it, read by
//! [`numbers`]. **Not in configuration and not in this process's memory**: the
//! numbers a tenant owns are a per-tenant fact, and a per-tenant fact behind a
//! deploy is a fact one replica can hold a stale copy of. Reading it inside the
//! request's own [`TenantTx`] costs one indexed query over five to ten rows and
//! removes the staleness question instead of answering it.
//!
//! Do not confuse the two tables this module touches. `phone_numbers` is what
//! an **operator** put in the shared pool — the tenant owns it. A number
//! `Step::Phone` bought for one employee lives in `employee_resources` under
//! the provider that sold it, and is that employee's alone. `employee_resources`
//! rows with `provider = "phone-pool"` are the third thing: a *seat* on a number
//! from the first table, which is what [`occupancy`] counts.
//!
//! # Inbound routing is not here
//!
//! A supplier texts the shared number. Which employee gets it? The one that
//! supplier has been talking to, always: since wave 8 an employee holds trust
//! links, learned expectations and beliefs with provenance about *that*
//! counterparty ([`agentos_domain::psyche`]), and a colleague holds none of
//! them. Routing the supplier elsewhere silently throws the relationship away.
//!
//! That rule lives in [`crate::inbound::resolve_phone_recipient`], which is what
//! [`crate::inbound::land_inbound_text`] calls — and since
//! `0069_a_number_is_an_endpoint_too` a real customer's SMS reaches it, so the
//! NOT WIRED note this paragraph used to send you to is gone. This
//! module had a `route_inbound` of its own that said the same thing and that
//! nothing outside `#[cfg(test)]` ever called, not even the lander. It was not
//! merely redundant — it was **narrower**: two queries instead of one,
//! `step = 'phone'` hard-coded so a pooled WhatsApp slot could not route at all,
//! `provider = 'phone-pool'` so a dedicated number could not either, and no
//! `state = 'ready'` filter, so a released slot still counted. It is deleted;
//! the argument for the tie-breaks lives on `resolve_phone_recipient`.
//!
//! What is left here is the operator's view of the same fact: [`affinities`]
//! lists who currently holds which counterparty on which number, including the
//! rows that are no longer routable, and [`reassign`] moves one deliberately.
