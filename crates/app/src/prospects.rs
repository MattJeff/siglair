//! The seller's input: the founder's own lists, become rows.
//!
//! [`crate::queue`] is the other end of this — it takes `contacts` that are due
//! and produces the file he uploads. It has always had a producer and no
//! source: `insert_account` and `insert_contact` are called from tests and from
//! nothing else, so in production the pipeline tables are empty and every query
//! over them returns nothing. Meanwhile ~1,600 prospects sit in
//! Smartlead-shaped CSVs on a laptop. This module is the missing half hour:
//! read those files, write those rows, twice if you like.
//!
//! # The shape it reads
//!
//! The founder's eight columns, and they are [`crate::queue::COLUMNS`]`[..8]`
//! rather than a second copy of the same list — the export's header and the
//! import's header are the same eight names by construction, and
//! `crates/app/tests/fixtures/smartlead_getorizn_prospection.csv` is a cut of
//! the real file that both are asserted against.
//!
//! # What identifies a prospect
//!
//! Two natural keys, one per table, and both are unique constraints
//! `0011_revenue.sql` already carries rather than new rules invented here.
//!
//! **An account is its domain** — `unique (tenant_id, domain)`. The domain comes
//! from `website` when the row has one and from the address otherwise, in that
//! order, because the schema says what a domain is *for*: "the identity of a
//! prospect: names are spelled six ways and a booking flow lives at a domain".
//! The booking flow lives at the website, not at the MX, and the proof-of-need
//! probe that this vertical is built around visits the former. In the founder's
//! lists the two disagree for 338 of the 1,552 rows that carry both — an
//! association whose site is `reisebueros.at` and whose mailbox is at `wko.at` —
//! so this is a choice with consequences and not a tidy-up.
//!
//! A `www.` prefix is dropped and nothing else is: it is the one cosmetic prefix
//! that never distinguishes two companies, and dropping it is what makes
//! `https://www.oerv.at` and `office@oerv.at` one account instead of two.
//!
//! ponytail: no public-suffix list. `Domain::parse` gives the full host, so
//! `aastravel.com.hk` is the account rather than `com.hk`, which is the right
//! answer here and the wrong one for a subdomain — `travel.example.com` and
//! `example.com` would be two accounts. Reach for the `publicsuffix` crate the
//! day a list carries subdomains; these do not.
//!
//! **A contact is its address** — `unique (tenant_id, email)`. Not the name
//! (there usually is not one), not the company (people move), and not a pair of
//! them. It is also what the suppression list is keyed on, which is the argument
//! that settles it: a second row for one address is a row that dodges the
//! opt-out cascade, and `0011_revenue.sql` says exactly that where it declares
//! the constraint.
//!
//! Running the same file twice therefore writes nothing the second time, and so
//! does running two files that overlap — which is not hypothetical: the
//! `getorizn_*` and `oriznapi_*` lists are the same 1,100 people under two
//! sending domains, and of 2,209 prospect rows only 1,133 are distinct people.
//!
//! # An import cannot wake a suppressed address
//!
//! This is the reason [`crate::queue`] exists in the shape it does and the
//! reason this module does not simply loop over `insert_contact`. The write goes
//! through [`upsert_contact`](agentos_store::revenue::upsert_contact), which
//! calls `revenue_suppression_of` **inside the INSERT**: a suppressed address is
//! never inserted, an existing inactive row for it is never touched, and the
//! BEFORE trigger on `contacts` is still underneath refusing an active
//! suppressed row whatever the statement thinks. The report counts them.
//!
//! # What it will not do
//!
//! **It will not invent a first name.** 3,012 of 3,048 rows across every list
//! have neither a first nor a last name, because they are `info@` and
//! `contact@` inboxes; `full_name` is the two fields joined, which for those
//! rows is the empty string. That is a fact about the list and the import
//! records it as one. It is *also* a September problem — Smartlead's
//! `add_leads_to_campaign` marks `first_name` required — and
//! [`Report::nameless`] is the number the founder has to make a decision about.
//! `SELECT count(*) FROM contacts WHERE full_name = ''` asks the same question
//! of the database.
//!
//! **It will not guess a country.** `accounts.country` is ISO-2 with a CHECK and
//! the lists carry `États-Unis`, `Mandaluyong, Philippines` and `inconnu` — 118
//! spellings in three languages. The verbatim string goes to `accounts.location`
//! (`0033_prospect_listing.sql`) and `country` is `ZZ` unless the operator
//! passes one, which is right for `--country PH` over the DMW list and honest
//! for FIDI, which is worldwide.
//!
//! **It will not bend a phone number.** `contacts.phone` is E.164 because
//! `revenue_suppression_of` matches a phone by string equality; 584 of the 2,044
//! numbers in these lists are not E.164 (`(02)83518906`) and turning one into
//! one means guessing a country per row. They are dropped, counted in
//! [`Report::phones_dropped`], and still in the founder's CSV.
//!
//! **It will not keep a `linkedin_profile`.** There is no column for it on
//! `accounts` or `contacts`, and there is no value for it either: all 3,048 rows
//! are empty. Adding a column for a field nobody has filled is a guess about its
//! shape. If one is ever filled, [`Report::linkedin_dropped`] says so and that
//! is the day for the migration.
//!
//! # Where it is called from
//!
//! `agentos-server import`, beside `agentos-server policy install`, for the same
//! reason and one more. The files are on the founder's laptop: a route would
//! need them uploaded to a server that has no reason to hold them, through a
//! multipart body nothing else in this API uses, authorised by an API key that
//! would then be a way to bulk-write another tenant's pipeline. A subcommand
//! runs on `DATABASE_URL` — the credential the operator already has — and adds
//! nothing to the HTTP surface. This module is the library half, so the day
//! there is a hosted control plane with a file picker, the route calls `import`
//! and none of the rules above move.
//!
//! # The second door: [`discover`]
//!
//! The founder's instruction is that finding prospects is the employee's job
//! too, and [`discover`] is the honest half of that. It is the **same door** as
//! [`import`] — the same two natural keys, the same
//! [`upsert_account`](agentos_store::revenue::upsert_account) and
//! [`upsert_contact`](agentos_store::revenue::upsert_contact), the same
//! suppression check inside the same INSERT, the same [`Report`] — with a page
//! where the CSV was. There is deliberately no second write path: a discovered
//! address that reached `contacts` by any route other than the one an imported
//! one takes would be an address that dodges the opt-out cascade.
//!
//! Four things are different, and each of them is a refusal.
//!
//! **The page does not get to write prose.** An imported `company_name` is the
//! founder's own text and goes to `accounts.legal_name`; a page's is a
//! stranger's, and `legal_name` is what `Flow::prospect` renders into an
//! outbound subject line
//! ([`crate::proof_of_need`], [`crate::vertical::Approach::new`]). So a
//! discovered account's `legal_name` **is its domain** — a value
//! [`Domain::parse`] produced, which cannot contain a space, let alone a
//! sentence. Nothing a page authored is stored, which is a stronger statement
//! than "nothing a page authored is sent": there is no field to sanitise later
//! because there is no field. What is lost is the company's spelling of its own
//! name, which a directory page is a poor source of anyway — it is as likely to
//! be `Home | Kontakt` as a legal entity.
//!
//! **The page does not get to be read *about*.** [`addresses`] takes the
//! addresses printed on the page and nothing else — no name, no phone, no
//! country, no description. Everything that survives went through
//! [`EmailAddress::parse`], and the caller is handed counts rather than
//! anything the page wrote, so no byte of it crosses back into a model's
//! context by this route.
//!
//! **An address on a page is not a permission to email it.** A discovered
//! contact lands exactly where an imported one lands: `next_follow_up_at = now`,
//! `lawful_basis = legitimate_interest`, in [`crate::queue::plan`]'s meter and
//! under the gate's cold-outreach budget. Nobody is written to by discovering
//! them.
//!
//! **It is bounded by the policy, not by a number written here.**
//! `max_new_contacts_per_day` is the ceiling, counted against
//! [`new_contacts_since`](agentos_store::revenue::new_contacts_since) — the
//! reader whose own docs say it is "the number `max_new_contacts_per_day` is
//! compared against" and which until now had no caller. It intersects across
//! the four policy layers, no model can reach it, and
//! [`crate::rolepack_sales`] ships it at `0`: a fresh seller discovers nobody
//! until an operator who can answer for the lawful basis raises it. Storing
//! somebody's business address is processing their personal data, so metering
//! the *creation* of a contact with the same number that meters approaching one
//! is not a borrowed limit — it is the earlier end of the same obligation.
//!
//! ponytail: no free-mailbox list. A directory whose members all write from
//! `@163.com` becomes one `163.com` account with sixty contacts under it —
//! [`import`] refuses those rows because they carry no `company_name`, and a
//! page has no `company_name` to be missing. The report says `1 account, 60
//! contacts`, which is legible enough for an operator to notice. Add a provider
//! list the day a directory that matters is full of them.
