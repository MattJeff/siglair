//! The provisioning engine: eleven steps, one worker, no duplicate purchases.
//!
//! The engine drives an employee from "row in a table" to "can send email, own
//! a phone number and hold its own secrets". Everything here exists to make one
//! sentence true: **a crash never buys a second phone number.**
//!
//! # No registry
//!
//! There is no `Vec<Arc<dyn Provisioner>>` and no map from step to handler.
//! [`ProvisioningEngine::ensure_step`] reaches exactly one exhaustive `match`
//! over [`Step`] ([`ProvisioningEngine::call`]) and one over which adapter owns
//! it ([`adapter_of`]). Add a twelfth step and the build breaks in both places,
//! which is the entire point: a registry would have compiled fine and silently
//! never provisioned it.
//!
//! # The order steps run in
//!
//! Not [`Step::ALL`] order — that lists `Browser` *before* the `Vault` it loads
//! credentials from. The waves are computed from [`Step::depends_on`] on every
//! pass ([`plan_wave`]), so the dependency edges are the only source of order
//! and a new edge needs no change here. Within a wave the steps are independent
//! by construction and run concurrently in a bounded [`JoinSet`].
//!
//! # One step, in order
//!
//! ```text
//! tx1: sweep -> claim_step -> begin_intent            COMMIT   ("a call may happen")
//!      provider call, under tokio::time::timeout               (the crash window)
//! tx2: finish_step: resource + binding + outbox       COMMIT   (guarded by our lease)
//! ```
//!
//! The intent row is committed **before** the network call, so a process that
//! dies in the crash window leaves evidence. The timeout is not optional: an
//! unbounded await is how a worker hangs forever holding a lease that nobody
//! else may steal until it lapses.
//!
//! # Nothing is bought for a capability that reaches nothing
//!
//! A step can be finished four ways, not three. `Ready` and `Failed` and
//! `PendingExternal` all assume somebody wanted the resource; the fourth,
//! [`StepReport::NotWired`], is for a capability that is built at the provider
//! end and connected to nothing at the product end. `Step::Phone` was exactly
//! that — an E.164 number bought on every hire, billing monthly, with no tool in
//! [`crate::turn::catalogue`] able to send or receive on it — and it had to be a
//! fourth answer rather than a failure, because an optional step that fails
//! leaves every employee in every deployment `Health::Degraded` forever over a
//! channel nobody asked for. It settles in `ResourceState::Disabled`, which is
//! the one state that means *off on purpose*, and the reason goes on the row.
//! [`EngineConfig::provision_phone`] is the switch and carries the argument for
//! why an operator does not get to flip it.
//!
//! # Two ways to have a phone number
//!
//! [`EngineConfig::number_strategy`] decides whether `Step::Phone` buys a
//! number ([`NumberStrategy::Dedicated`], and unchanged) or takes a slot on one
//! the tenant already owns ([`NumberStrategy::Pooled`]). The pooled path is the
//! cheaper *regulatory* path, not the cheaper invoice: one French bundle and
//! one human review serve twenty employees instead of twenty of each. It buys
//! only when no slot is free, releases the slot rather than the number, and
//! spells its binding exactly like `Step::Whatsapp`'s shared company sender —
//! see `ProvisioningEngine::take_pooled_slot`.
//!
//! # Orphans are never retried
//!
//! An intent left `in_flight` by a worker whose lease has lapsed has an
//! **unknown outcome** — the phone number may or may not have been bought, and
//! nothing we hold says which. Retrying it is how you buy two. So the engine
//! files an approval for a human, marks the intent `orphaned`, and refuses to
//! touch that step again: every later pass sees the `orphaned` intent and
//! parks. The refusal is durable, not a flag in this process's memory.
//!
//! That is the *only* thing here that needs a human. A step that failed with an
//! answer — a 4xx, an exhausted retry budget — is retried freely, because the
//! adapter contract is reconcile-before-create and a retry with the same
//! [`agentos_domain::ids::IdempotencyKey`] finds what it already paid for.
