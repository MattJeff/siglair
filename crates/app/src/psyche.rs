//! The psyche's wire: the one observation this codebase can honestly make, and
//! the one decision it is allowed to change.
//!
//! `agentos_domain::psyche` is a set of accumulators that take facts as
//! parameters and read no clock. `agentos_store::psyche` is the log they fold
//! over. This module is the only thing that connects the two to something that
//! ships.
//!
//! # What is observed, and what is not
//!
//! An [`Expectation`] is *observed* against *claimed* in natural units, and a
//! dimension fed by anything other than the thing it names is worse than a
//! dimension left empty — the belief would converge, look confident, and be
//! about something else. So exactly one dimension is wired:
//!
//! | Dimension | Source in this codebase | Wired |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`Dimension::ResponseLatencyHours`] | the gap between our outbound message on a thread and their next inbound one — both rows exist in `messages`, both timestamps are ours | **yes** |
//! | `Dimension::LeadTimeDays` | `quotes.lead_time_days` is what a supplier *claims*. Nothing in this workspace records a delivery: no production caller writes `purchase_orders` or `shipments`, so the observed half does not exist | no |
//! | `Dimension::PriceDeltaBps` | needs a quoted price and an *agreed* one. Only the quote exists; nothing records what was finally paid | no |
//! | `Dimension::MoqFlexibilityPct` | `quotes` has no MOQ column — see `vertical::answers`, which fills `moq` with `NonZeroU32::MIN` because there is nothing to read | no |
//! | `Dimension::DefectRatePct` | needs an incoming inspection. There is no inspection anywhere in this product | no |
//!
//! `supplier_observations` is the one that came off this list.
//! `store::sourcing::close_expired_rounds` writes `quote_returned` /
//! `quote_missed` as it closes a round, so the reputation view has a feed, and
//! `vertical::answers` is what drives it on the production path. Nothing is
//! written from *here*, and that is still right: this module is about the
//! psyche's expectations, and an observation is the sourcing round's own
//! record of who answered.
//!
//! # The governing invariant
//!
//! **Nothing here may reach an authorisation.** No value in this module is an
//! input to `domain::policy::evaluate`, to `PolicyGate::decide` or to any
//! `Authorized<A>`; the only thing that leaves is a sentence in the note the
//! employee reads before it thinks. `docs/PSYCHE_PORT.md` §0 asks for one grep
//! in CI to keep it that way, "in the PR that gives the psyche its first
//! production caller". This is that PR, and the grep is
//! [`tests::nothing_psyche_derived_can_reach_an_authorisation`] — a test rather
//! than a shell line, so it runs wherever the suite runs.
//!
//! # Determinism, and where forgetting runs
//!
//! Nothing is cached. [`standing`] folds the episode log every time it is
//! asked, so the expectation and the [`Ledger`] are a pure function of
//! `(the rows, now)` — the same log read twice at the same instant produces the
//! same belief, bit for bit.
//!
//! That is also **where forgetting runs**, and it is the reproducible half of
//! the choice. A [`Ledger`] persisted in a table and decayed by a scheduler
//! ends up in a state that depends on when the scheduler happened to fire,
//! which no log can reproduce; a ledger replayed over the real gaps between
//! real observations, and then aged once more over the silence since the last
//! one, depends on nothing else. `Ledger::decay` is already a pure function of
//! the [`chrono::Duration`] handed to it and carries its sub-period remainder,
//! which is exactly what makes the replay exact.

// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
// What is deliberately still unwired, and why
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
//
// `psyche_expectations` — not written. Its columns are MPCP's *sign-valued*
// model: `expectation` is CHECKed to `[-1, 1]` and `surprise_mean` /
// `surprise_var` are a Welford over `|surprise|`. The domain deliberately ships
// the magnitude-valued replacement `docs/PSYCHE_PORT.md` §5.2 argues for — the
// expectation is in hours, the Welford is over the raw observations, and there
// are two CUSUM accumulators and a `claimed` the table has no column for. "23
// hours" does not fit `[-1, 1]`, so writing it would mean either a lie about
// the units or a migration; folding the episodes costs neither and cannot
// disagree with the log it came from. The table's own header makes the same
// argument about `precision`.
//
// `psyche_beliefs` / `psyche_belief_episodes` — not written. `beliefs.rs`
// consolidates `N_CONSOLIDATION = 3` concordant episodes about one subject into
// a durable belief, and the only subject with three concordant episodes here is
// "slow to answer", which is the expectation restated. A belief that adds no
// information is a second place for the same fact to be wrong. The genealogy
// tables are ready for the first belief that is *not* a restatement — a lead
// time missed, a spec substituted — which needs the events the table above says
// do not exist.
//
// `links.rs` / the `trust` column — read and preserved, never moved.
// `TrustEvent` is `PromiseKept`, `CommitmentBroken`, `FaultRepeated`; each one
// is a commitment whose fulfilment we watched. There is no purchase order, no
// shipment and no inspection in this product, so there is no honest event to
// feed it. What this module writes to `psyche_trust` is two timestamps —
// "we are waiting since" and "they last spoke at" — and it leaves `trust` on its
// prior, which is precisely what `psyche_trust_needs_evidence` permits and what
// an opinion with no evidence behind it should look like.
