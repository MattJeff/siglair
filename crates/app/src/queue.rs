//! The seller's output: who to write to today, with what, and the two ways
//! that leaves the building.
//!
//! [`crate::vertical::sell`] ends in [`Seller::touch`](crate::revenue::Seller::touch)
//! — it decides *and* it sends, in one function. That is right when the mailer
//! is ours. It is wrong right now, because it is not: until 2026-09-01 the
//! founder loads Smartlead by hand, so the deliverable is a **file**, and from
//! 2026-09-01 it is an **API call**. Two sinks, one decision.
//!
//! So this module is `sell`'s last step, cut off and turned into a value.
//! Everything before it is unchanged and unduplicated: the authority lookup,
//! the two probe runs, the [`Evidence`](crate::proof_of_need::Evidence), the
//! [`Approach`] rendered from it. What changes is only what happens to the
//! `Approach` — `sell` hands it to a provider, [`plan`] puts it in a [`Lead`].
//!
//! # Where the seam is, and why there
//!
//! **[`plan`] returns `Vec<Lead>` and knows nothing about files or HTTP.** That
//! is the whole boundary. A sink is a plain function over `&[Lead]`, and there
//! are now two of them: [`csv`] and [`push`]. There is still deliberately **no
//! `Sink` trait**, and writing the second one is what proved the point — they
//! share no signature. [`csv`] returns a `String` and cannot fail; [`push`] is
//! `async`, needs the gate and a principal, and returns one
//! [`Contacted`](crate::revenue::Contacted) per recipient. A trait over that
//! pair would have one method neither implements comfortably and a lowest
//! common denominator that hides the gate.
//!
//! What they *do* share is the two arrays: [`Lead::fields`] pairs
//! index-for-index with [`COLUMNS`], and both sinks read exactly that pair —
//! one with commas between the values, one with the names beside them. So both
//! name the same ten things and neither can name an eleventh.
//!
//! **[`plan`] did not move**, and neither did [`csv`], [`record_queued`] or
//! [`COLUMNS`]. The trait the API call lives behind is
//! [`LeadSink`](agentos_providers::leads::LeadSink), in `agentos-providers`,
//! reached through [`crate::effects`] like every other provider.
//!
//! # Nothing reaches a sink that could not be defended
//!
//! A [`Lead`]'s fields are private and [`plan`] is the only thing that builds
//! one. [`plan`] takes [`Ready`], which carries an [`Approach`], whose only
//! constructor takes an `&Evidence`, which carries a private zero-sized seal
//! that only [`Prober::check`](crate::proof_of_need::Prober::check) can mint and
//! only after the prospect's own flow said the same thing to two identical runs.
//!
//! The chain is the existing one and this module adds no second seal to it — a
//! row with no reproduced finding behind it is a program that does not compile,
//! at `tests/ui/queue_lead_without_evidence.rs` and
//! `tests/ui/vertical_approach_without_evidence.rs`. What an `Evidence` *says*
//! is not this module's business: [`Lead`] copies
//! [`Outreach`](crate::revenue::Outreach)'s two rendered strings and never looks
//! inside them, so a finding that changes from "your data is wrong" to "your
//! page is missing a whole category" changes nothing here.
//!
//! # The three refusals, and they are the send path's own
//!
//! An export that skipped these would be worse than no export, because a file
//! the founder uploads *is* a send — with the safety checks a day later and a
//! system boundary away. So [`plan`] applies the same ones
//! [`Seller::touch`](crate::revenue::Seller::touch) and the gate apply, from the
//! same values:
//!
//! 1. **Suppression.** The same [`Suppression`] the [`Seller`](crate::revenue::Seller)
//!    holds — pass `seller.suppression()`. First, before anything else, exactly
//!    as in `touch`. The database says it again and more strongly:
//!    `suppressions_deactivate_contacts` in `0011_revenue.sql` sets both
//!    `active = false` **and** `next_follow_up_at = NULL` on the rows an opt-out
//!    names, in the same statement, and
//!    [`contacts_due_for_follow_up`](agentos_store::revenue::contacts_due_for_follow_up)
//!    filters on both. Deleting either half of that `WHERE` still keeps a
//!    suppressed person out of the queue — which is the shape you want a legal
//!    boundary in, and it is why the check here is a third lock rather than the
//!    only one.
//! 2. **The contact budget.** `max_new_contacts_per_day` off the role pack,
//!    minus what today has already spent. It is a **limit an operator raises**,
//!    so a queue is truncated to it and never padded up to it — and
//!    `sales_development()` ships it at `0`, which makes the honest answer for
//!    an unconfigured employee an empty file.
//! 3. **May this employee send email at all.** [`ActionKind::EmailSend`] must be
//!    proposable and [`Channel::Email`] permitted. The per-segment channel
//!    *choice* stays in [`sell`](crate::vertical::sell), which has the segment;
//!    a Smartlead list is an email list by construction.
//!
//! # Running it twice
//!
//! The founder will. Idempotence is the `contacts` table and not a file this
//! module writes for itself: [`record_queued`] calls
//! [`mark_contacted`](agentos_store::revenue::mark_contacted) with
//! `next_follow_up_at = now + `[`FOLLOW_UP_AFTER`], which is the same spacing
//! [`Sequence::due`](crate::revenue::Sequence) meters, so the second run's
//! [`contacts_due_for_follow_up`](agentos_store::revenue::contacts_due_for_follow_up)
//! does not return them.
//!
//! **Commit [`record_queued`] before writing the file.** Both orders can fail
//! and they fail differently: mark-then-write loses a prospect for three days
//! when the disk is full, write-then-mark mails them twice when the commit is.
//! A prospect who gets the same cold email twice reports it, and a sending
//! domain does not recover from that on a schedule.
//!
//! # Who calls this, and why only one thing can
//!
//! `apps/server/src/routes/queue.rs` — `POST /v1/employees/{id}/queue/export`,
//! and nothing else in the workspace. That rule above admits exactly one shape:
//! the mark has to commit before the bytes exist, so the bytes have to be handed
//! to somebody in the same breath, so the caller has to be a request rather than
//! a cadence. [`crate::vertical::selling_turn`]'s docs make the argument from the
//! other end and name this route.
//!
//! The route holds one transaction across [`due`], [`suppression`], [`plan`],
//! [`record_queued`] and [`csv`], so there is no state in which somebody is
//! marked contacted and the file that says so does not exist. What it hands back
//! is JSON with the CSV in it, so that the API stack's idempotency layer — which
//! stores `jsonb` — can replay the exact bytes of a response that was lost in
//! flight. That is where the residual risk of mark-then-write actually goes.
//!
//! [`due`] is where a [`Ready`] comes from: `contacts` that are due, joined to
//! the opener their account's newest fresh finding came to.
//! [`file_finding`](crate::vertical) stores that opener when the turn renders
//! it; see `0035_evidence_opener.sql` for why it lives on the `evidence` row and
//! not in a queue table.
//!
//! # The September sink: what is built, and what the founder still owes it
//!
//! [`push`] is built and wired; the **adapter behind the trait is not**, and the
//! two open items at the end of this list are why. The shape, from the live tool
//! schemas:
//!
//! * **Endpoint.** `POST /api/v1/campaigns/{campaign_id}/leads`, MCP
//!   `add_leads_to_campaign`. Body is `{ lead_list: [...], settings: {...} }`,
//!   **max 100 leads per request** — so a sink chunks `&[Lead]` by 100.
//! * **Per lead.** `email`, `first_name`, `last_name`, `company_name`,
//!   `phone_number`, `website`, `linkedin_profile`, `location` — the eight
//!   [`COLUMNS`] under the same names — plus `custom_fields: object`, which is
//!   where the last two go: `{"objet_email": …, "angle_email": …}`. There is
//!   also a `company_url` the CSVs do not use; leave it out.
//! * **`settings` is a legal boundary in a JSON object.** It takes
//!   `ignore_global_block_list`, `ignore_unsubscribe_list` and
//!   `ignore_duplicate_leads_in_other_campaign`. **The first two must be sent
//!   `false`, explicitly, never omitted and never `true`** — they are a
//!   documented way to mail someone who opted out, and a default nobody wrote
//!   down is a default that changes. The third is Smartlead's own copy of
//!   [`record_queued`]'s job and should be `false` too, so a duplicate is an
//!   error we see rather than a silent skip.
//! * **Sequences.** `save_campaign_sequences` takes `seq_variants` with
//!   `subject` and `email_body`. The campaign's subject is `{{objet_email}}` and
//!   its body `{{angle_email}}`; both come off the lead's `custom_fields`. The
//!   founder writes that sequence **once**, by hand, and this module never
//!   touches it — `save_campaign_sequences` overwrites live copy for every lead
//!   already in the campaign.
//! * **Credentials.** One `SMARTLEAD_API_KEY`, through
//!   [`crate::secrets`] like every other provider secret, never a literal. It is
//!   account-wide and unscoped: the same key that adds a lead can delete a
//!   campaign, so the sink must only ever call the one endpoint above.
//! * **What the founder has to decide,** and none of it is inferable:
//!   1. **Which `campaign_id`.** There is one campaign per segment already
//!      (`smartlead_associations_ectaa`, `_dmw`, `_fidi`, `_hongkong`,
//!      `_chine`) times two sending domains (`getorizn.com`, `oriznapi.uk`).
//!      The producer has no segment→campaign map and must not guess one.
//!   2. **Whether the sink sends at all, or only stages.** Adding leads to an
//!      *active* campaign starts mailing them on the next schedule tick. Adding
//!      to a paused one does not. Staging into a paused campaign keeps the
//!      human review step that the CSV era had for free.
//!   3. **`first_name` / `last_name` are `required` in the API and empty in
//!      every one of the founder's CSVs** — 0 of 32 ECTAA rows, 0 of 301 DMW
//!      rows have one, because these are `info@`/`contact@` inboxes. Empty
//!      strings are what the CSV upload sends today; whether the API accepts
//!      them is one call to find out, and if it does not the fallback is a
//!      decision about salutation, not a code change.
//!   4. **Which read endpoint lists the people who unsubscribed.**
//!      [`reconcile_opt_outs`] needs one and this codebase does not name it,
//!      because nobody here has looked at the live API — deliberately. It is the
//!      second of the two things an adapter cannot be written without, and it is
//!      the more important one: a campaign that mails is recoverable, an
//!      unsubscribe we never collected is not.
//!
//!      **This one no longer depends on anybody remembering it.**
//!      [`crate::catalog::OptOuts`] is a mandatory field on every catalogue
//!      entry, so a Smartlead connector cannot be added without naming where its
//!      opt-outs come in — and there is no "not wired yet" value to put there.
//!      The endpoint is still missing; what has changed is that the missing
//!      endpoint is now a build failure rather than a thing somebody meant to
//!      ask about. See that enum for where the line "this connector sends" falls
//!      and why the catalogue is what draws it.
//!
//! Items 1 and 4 are what stand between
//! [`LeadSink`](agentos_providers::leads::LeadSink) and a real adapter. Nothing
//! above them is blocked on anything: [`push`] and [`reconcile_opt_outs`] are
//! written, tested against the mock, and reached by
//! `apps/server/src/routes/queue.rs` the moment an operator grants
//! `allow_lead_upload`.
//!
//! # Fields the schema does not have
//!
//! [`Recipient`] takes all eight as strings from whoever loads the list, and
//! `crate::prospects` is now the thing that loads it. Two of them had no column
//! behind them at all; `0033_prospect_listing.sql` gave one of them one.
//!
//! * `location`. `accounts.country` is ISO 3166-1 alpha-2 with a CHECK and the
//!   founder's lists carry `États-Unis`, `Mandaluyong, Philippines`,
//!   `Portugal / Royaume-Uni`. **`accounts.location` now holds that string
//!   verbatim** and `country` is `ZZ` when nobody passed one, so the import
//!   guesses nothing and the export has the founder's own words to put back.
//! * `linkedin_profile`. Still no column anywhere, on `accounts` or `contacts` —
//!   and still no data either: it is empty in all 3,048 rows of every list. The
//!   importer counts any it meets and says so rather than storing it, which is
//!   the signal that this is the day for the migration.
//!
//! One more does not survive, and it is the importer's finding rather than this
//! module's: a `phone_number` that is not E.164 has nowhere to go, because
//! `contacts.phone` has a CHECK that exists so `revenue_suppression_of` can
//! match a number by equality. 584 of the 2,044 numbers in these lists are in
//! some other shape and are not stored. They are still in the CSVs.
//!
//! **Both halves of that rule are enforced now, and neither was when this module
//! was written.** `contacts` had no touch counter, so
//! [`MAX_TOUCHES`](crate::revenue::MAX_TOUCHES) and
//! [`Ended::Replied`](crate::revenue::Ended) were held on a `Sequence` rebuilt
//! empty every turn — a person could be mailed forever, and one who *replied*
//! stayed in the queue. `0036_contact_touches.sql` put `touch_count` on the row
//! and `mark_contacted` increments it, which is the one statement that means "we
//! just wrote to this person" — so the selling turn, the chase and
//! [`record_queued`] all count through it, and the limit bites in the
//! **selection** rather than being discovered after a turn is spent. A reply
//! clears `next_follow_up_at` from `inbound::land`, which is the only door
//! inbound mail has on any channel.
//!
//! The range this module asks for is `0..MAX_TOUCHES` and the chase asks for
//! `1..`, and the difference is not cosmetic: `prospects::import` writes
//! `next_follow_up_at = now` on every row it lands, so the overdue end of that
//! queue is the whole imported list with nobody written to yet. A bounded scan
//! from zero never reaches a real chase.

/// There is still no `Sink` trait, and the reason the module docs gave has

/// principal, and returns **one outcome per recipient** — the same
/// [`Contacted`] [`Seller::campaign`](crate::revenue::Seller::campaign) returns,
/// deliberately, so that an operator's dashboard counts `sent` / `refused` /
/// the deny code in the same labels whichever sink ran. What they share is the
/// slice, and the slice is the seam.
///
/// # The gate, per prospect, and which budget it spends
///
/// Every lead is authorised on its own as an [`ActionKind::EmailSend`] against
/// its own address — not one ruling for the batch — because that is what makes
/// the counterparty land in the audit payload, and the counterparty *is* the
/// cold-outreach budget: [`PolicyGate`](crate::gate::PolicyGate) derives
/// `new_contacts_today` by aggregating `audit_log` on it. A batch ruling would
/// spend one contact for forty people.
///
/// **So this path spends two different counters and they are not the same
/// number.** Worth stating plainly, because the export path spends only one:
///
/// * [`contacted_since`](agentos_store::revenue::contacted_since) — contacts
///   *written to*, off the `last_contacted_at` column [`record_queued`] writes.
///   This is what [`plan`]'s `spent_today` argument measures and what truncates
///   the queue before anything reaches here.
/// * the gate's own count over `audit_log`, which no `contacts` column feeds and
///   which only ever advances when the gate allows something. The CSV export
///   never touches it — the founder's upload is invisible to the audit trail —
///   so before this sink exists the two disagree by exactly the size of every
///   export ever run.
///
/// Neither of them is
/// [`new_contacts_since`](agentos_store::revenue::new_contacts_since), which
/// counts rows *created* in `contacts` and is what
/// [`crate::prospects::import`] spends. Importing a list and writing to it are
/// two different acts against one number, and this is the one that writes.
///
/// The two counters cannot double-charge one person on one day: `plan` offers
/// nobody twice — `record_queued` moves them out of `queueable` for
/// [`FOLLOW_UP_AFTER`] — and the gate charges only a
/// [`ContactStanding::New`](agentos_domain::action::ContactStanding), so a
/// prospect already in the trail is free forever after. What they *can* do is
/// disagree in the safe direction, and only in it: a tenant that exported forty
/// people this morning has `spent_today = 40` and an audit count of zero, so the
/// afternoon's push is truncated by the larger number. Nothing here re-widens
/// it.
///
/// # Marked before staged, which is the module's rule and not a new one
///
/// The caller commits [`record_queued`] **before** calling this, exactly as it
/// commits before writing the file. That is forced rather than chosen:
/// [`PolicyGate::authorize`](crate::gate::PolicyGate::authorize) opens and
/// commits its own transaction, so no ruling can join the export's, and holding
/// a transaction open across an HTTP call is the thing
/// [`crate::effects`] refuses to do anyway.
///
/// What it costs is unchanged and already argued: a crash between the commit and
/// the platform call loses a prospect for [`FOLLOW_UP_AFTER`]. What it buys is
/// that the reverse — staging first — mails a stranger the same cold email
/// twice, and a sending domain does not recover from that on a schedule.
///
/// A [`Contacted::Refused`] here is that same loss with a reason attached: the
/// person is marked contacted and was not written to. It should be rare, because

/// against a `suppressions` table that has never been reconciled with the
/// platform — which is the harm the paragraph above was written to prevent,
/// arriving through the branch it did not consider.
///
/// The guard is defensible and the conflation is not: the question the argument
/// needs is "is a real lead platform configured", because with none there is
/// nobody to ask and asking the mock invents an answer. The question the code
/// asks is "may this employee upload leads", which is a *policy* answer about a

/// `crate::mocks::ports_for` hands out a `MockLeadSink` unconditionally and has
/// no credential field to select on — so the fix is a real
/// [`LeadSink`](agentos_providers::leads::LeadSink) and its configuration
/// check, not a wider `if` here.
///

/// database transaction must not be held open across a call to a third party.
