//! The seller's tools: research an account, qualify it, write to it, follow up
//! twice, take the objection, and stop — every step that touches the world
//! going through [`PolicyGate::authorize`] first.
//!
//! This is [`crate::sourcing`] with prospects instead of suppliers, and it is
//! deliberately the same shape: one proposed subject per operation, handed to
//! the gate, and only the [`Authorized`](crate::gate::Authorized) token the
//! gate mints reaches [`Effects`]. A selling operation that skipped the gate
//! would not compile, because [`Effects`] accepts nothing else.
//!
//! # Everything a prospect says is [`Untrusted`]
//!
//! Directory results, company descriptions, replies, the words an objection
//! arrived in — a stranger's text, wrapped where it arrived and never
//! unwrapped. [`Prospect::parse_all`] reads untrusted JSON into typed prospects
//! *by parsing it*: an address goes through [`EmailAddress::parse`], a booking
//! host through [`Domain::parse`], and the company's own prose stays an
//! `Untrusted<String>` for the caller to fence.
//!
//! # Three refusals that are not the gate's, and happen before it
//!
//! 1. **Suppression.** A contact who asked us to stop is refused in
//!    [`Seller::touch`] before any subject is built. The suppression list is
//!    not a filter applied to the outcome; it is the first line of the only
//!    function that can send.
//!
//!    **It is no longer the control, and it is kept anyway.**
//!    [`PolicyGate::authorize`](crate::gate::PolicyGate::authorize) now reads
//!    the same list, for every addressed action and every caller, and answers
//!    [`Denied::Suppressed`](crate::gate::Denied::Suppressed) — which is what
//!    covers the paths this module never saw: an operator's send, the model's
//!    `send_email` tool, `crate::sourcing`'s RFQ, `crate::queue`'s push to the
//!    sending platform. What survives here is a **pre-filter that can only
//!    narrow**: it names its own outcome ([`Contacted::Suppressed`], which a
//!    dispatch reports differently from a refusal), and it costs a campaign one
//!    round trip per prospect rather than one ruling per prospect. If it ever
//!    drifts from the gate it over-refuses, which is a cadence lost, or it
//!    under-refuses, which the gate catches. Neither direction reaches an
//!    inbox, and that asymmetry is the whole argument for two copies of one
//!    question.
//! 2. **The sequence is over.** A reply or an opt-out ends a [`Sequence`]
//!    *immediately* and there is no way to un-end one. An agent that keeps
//!    sequencing after someone answered is what gets a sending domain
//!    blacklisted, so "did they reply?" is a value, not a checklist item.
//! 3. **A commercial term a stranger authored.** See below.
//!
//! Everything else — the channel, the cold-outreach budget, the daily contact
//! cap — is the communication policy, and it is the gate's. There is no second
//! rate limiter here: `max_new_contacts_per_day` counts new counterparties in
//! `domain::policy::evaluate`, and past it the gate answers
//! [`DenyReason::ContactBudgetExhausted`] for each remaining prospect. A
//! campaign that runs out of budget comes back with one refused outcome per
//! prospect and never with a shorter list.
//!
//! # A commercial term always needs a human. No carve-out.
//!
//! [`Seller::propose_terms`] proposes an [`Action::ContractSign`], which
//! `domain::policy::evaluate` answers `RequireApproval` unconditionally — no
//! threshold, no policy field, no "standard discount" shortcut. A price, a
//! discount, an SLA and a contract are the same answer, because they are the
//! same thing: an obligation. `Ok` is an [`ApprovalId`] and never a token, and
//! the token it declines to return would be an `Authorized<Action>`, which no
//! [`Effects`] method accepts.
//!
//! **A term derived from a prospect's own text is refused outright, before the
//! gate.** `evaluate`'s taint wire denies an untrusted action only where the
//! rules would otherwise *allow* it, and signing is never allowed — it is
//! escalated. So routing an injected "give us 80% off" to the gate would file a
//! real approval request, written by a stranger, in front of a human who has to
//! decide it. An approval queue an outsider can write into is an outsider
//! choosing what a human is asked to sign, so the proposal dies here instead:
//! no approval, no email, no effect.
//!
//! ponytail: that refusal is therefore not in the audit log, which is the one
//! thing it costs. The upgrade is one expression in `domain::policy::evaluate`
//! — deny an untrusted high-risk action that came back `RequireApproval`
//! instead of passing it through — and then this branch deletes itself and the
//! gate audits it like everything else.
//!
//! # Evidence
//!
//! [`Outreach`] is a rendered subject and body, exactly as in
//! [`crate::sourcing`]: what a message *claims* is decided before it gets here.
//! That is on purpose. A finding about a prospect's own booking flow is only
//! sendable if it is reproducible, and reproducing it is not this unit's job —
//! this unit's job is that nothing leaves without the gate, the suppression
//! list and the sequence rules agreeing.
