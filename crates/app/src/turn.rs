//! The agent turn: the loop that makes an employee work.
//!
//! `event → context → reason → propose → GATE → execute → record`, repeated
//! while the model keeps asking for tools. Everything else in this crate is a
//! rule; this is the thing that runs.
//!
//! # Every proposal goes through the gate
//!
//! A tool call from the model is a *request*. [`Turn::perform`] turns it into a
//! subject, hands that to [`PolicyGate::authorize`], and only the resulting
//! [`Authorized`](crate::gate::Authorized) reaches [`Effects`] — which accepts
//! nothing else, by construction. A refusal is not an error: it is handed back
//! to the model as a failed tool result naming the deny code, which is how an
//! agent learns to stop asking for the thing it will never be given.
//!
//! # The taint wire
//!
//! This is the link the loop exists to close. A [`Context`] carries a
//! [`TrustLabel`] — [`TrustLabel::Untrusted`] the moment any third-party text
//! is in it — and [`tools_for`] filters the tool schemas by it. A turn that has
//! read a supplier's email is not offered the payment tool *at all*. Not
//! offered-and-then-denied: the schema is absent, so the model is never even
//! tempted to spend a turn asking.
//!
//! # The role floor, the policy, and why trust is asked first
//!
//! [`tools_for`] narrows three times: by trust, then by the set of
//! [`ActionKind`]s the employee's role pack says it may propose, then by what
//! its policy could ever allow. The order in that sentence is the security
//! order. Trust is the control — a tainted turn loses `pay` whatever job it
//! holds, and a pack listing [`ActionKind::PaymentCreate`] does not buy it back
//! — and the two below it are *narrowings on top*, never widenings: they can
//! only take schemas away. A customer success employee is therefore never shown
//! `pay`, rather than being shown it and refused by the gate, which is what
//! [`may_propose`](crate::rolepack::RolePack::may_propose) claimed to do and
//! for a long time did not, because this catalogue was not pack-aware.
//!
//! The third filter is the same fix one seam further along. A pack may list
//! [`ActionKind::McpCall`] and an operator may still have granted no MCP tool
//! at all — which is every fresh deployment, because `store::policy`'s
//! `default_ceiling` grants none — and the employee was offered `call_mcp_tool`
//! anyway, with no inventory and two free strings to guess with. Every guess
//! came back `deny/no_rule`. So the catalogue asks
//! [`always_denies`](agentos_domain::policy::always_denies), which answers the
//! only question a *kind* has an answer to: is every action of this kind
//! unconditionally refused? Anything less certain than that stays on offer and
//! the gate rules on it per action, because a schema withheld in error is an
//! employee failing silently and a schema offered in error costs one turn and
//! writes a row.
//!
//! The floor arrives as a plain `BTreeSet<ActionKind>` rather than as a pack,
//! and that is deliberate: `rolepack::RolePack` and `rolepack_service::RolePack`
//! are separate types with the same-named methods, and a trait over them would
//! be one method with two implementations, existing only so this function could
//! call `.proposable()` itself. The set is the whole of what this function
//! needs, so the set is what it takes — see [`crate::rolepack_service`]'s module
//! docs, which wrote this fix down before it was made.
//!
//! The label is not fixed for the run. An MCP result is a stranger's text, so
//! the moment one comes back the rest of the turn is untrusted and the
//! high-risk schemas disappear from the next request.
//!
//! **Withheld means unavailable, not merely unmentioned.** [`Turn::propose`]
//! refuses a name this turn may not propose — the first two filters above,
//! trust and the role floor — so a model that remembers `pay` from a cleaner
//! turn does not get a `Proposal::Pay` out of guessing at it. That sentence
//! used to read the other way: the schema filter saved a turn and the gate was
//! the control. On 2026-08-28 the gate had a hole exactly where it mattered —
//! `policy::evaluate`'s taint wire skipped its `RequireApproval` branch, the
//! branch every payment takes under a one-dollar `approval_above`, and an
//! injected email reached the founder's approval queue with its own payee on
//! it. Defence in depth is two layers or it is a word: the taint still travels
//! into the gate as `Untrusted<Subject>`, where `domain::policy::evaluate`
//! refuses high-risk actions outright, and that layer now only has to be right
//! when this one is wrong. The floor gets its first enforcement at all — the
//! gate has never been pack-aware, so until now a seat that guessed a verb
//! outside its charter was ruled on exactly like the seat that holds it.
//!
//! **The third filter is deliberately not enforced here**, and the asymmetry is
//! the point. `always_denies` is an economy over a policy the gate re-reads per
//! action; trust and the floor are facts about the turn, settled before the
//! request was built. A name the policy withheld therefore still reaches the
//! gate, is refused there, and leaves the row an operator reads — and the
//! employee is not scored as one that narrated a day it did not have.
//!
//! What the two that *are* enforced cost is that row: a name refused here never
//! becomes a subject, so there is no decision to record, and the attempt is
//! counted in [`Finished::malformed_calls`] — which the agent loops log —
//! rather than in the audit. A gate that recorded a decision it never made
//! would be the worse of the two.
//!
//! The taint filter is [`visible`], and it is one function on purpose:
//! [`tools_for`] filters the schemas with it and
//! [`SystemPrompt::render`](crate::prompt::SystemPrompt::render) filters the
//! MCP inventory with it. Two predicates would be two chances for a tool to be
//! *named* to a turn that may not *call* it, which is the leak this whole unit
//! is about.
//!
//! # Why MCP tools do not each get a schema
//!
//! [`catalogue`] has one `call_mcp_tool` entry with `{server, tool, arguments}`
//! for every tool on every bound server, and expanding it into one schema per
//! bound tool was considered and rejected.
//!
//! The reason is not effort, it is arithmetic. Tool count is a property of the
//! model's accuracy, not of our plumbing: past roughly seventy tools a model
//! starts picking the almost-right one, and MCP inventory is exactly the thing
//! that grows without bound — one ERP server is forty tools nobody at this
//! company wrote. The collapsed form is what keeps this catalogue the size it
//! is no matter how many servers a tenant binds, and it keeps the *gate*
//! at one subject type too: `Action::McpCall { tool }`, one allowlist,
//! `allowed_mcp_tools`. N schemas would be N names to keep in step with that
//! allowlist, and a schema whose name has drifted out of the allowlist is a
//! tool the model is offered and always denied.
//!
//! What was genuinely missing was smaller and is fixed elsewhere: **nothing
//! told the model which server and tool names exist.** The schema says
//! `{"server": "string", "tool": "string"}` and the model had to guess, so it
//! guessed, and `allowed_mcp_tools` denied the guess — a real MCP integration
//! looked like a broken one. [`crate::mcp::Fleet::inventory`] produces the list
//! of names and `SystemPrompt` renders it into the prefix, trust-filtered and
//! narrowed to the entries of `allowed_mcp_tools` this employee holds — so the
//! names it is given are the names the gate will accept, which is the whole
//! point of giving it names. One schema, a named inventory.
//!
//! The one thing the collapsed form gives up is per-tool argument validation:
//! `arguments` is an open object, and a wrong shape is found by the MCP server
//! rather than by the model's decoder. That is a wasted tool call, not an
//! unauthorised effect — the gate ruled on `server/tool`, which is what
//! `arguments` cannot change.
//!
//! # Four budgets, one checkpoint
//!
//! Turns, tool calls, tokens and a [`CancellationToken`]. They are checked in
//! exactly one function, [`Budgets::check`], called at the top of every turn
//! and again before every single tool call. One place, so a new budget cannot
//! be enforced in three of the four paths, and *before* the effect, so a
//! cancellation can never leave half a side effect behind. Without them a
//! misdirected agent bills for three days.

         This reason used to name a conversation clock and a template registry. The clock exists: \
         `0069` wired the telephony ingest, an inbound WhatsApp message is a dated `messages` row \
         on a thread, and `Effects::whatsapp_window` reads it and mints the `OpenWindow` that \
         `RenderedWhatsapp::FreeForm` needs — which until then could be obtained nowhere outside \
         a test, and which now names the counterparty it was minted for, so a real window with \
         one number cannot carry free text to another. So the ordinary case, answering somebody \
         who wrote to us in the last 24 hours, is built end to end. **This entry is NOT the only \
         thing between an employee and it**, and the sentence that said so was wrong in both \
         directions at once: it undersold the protection and oversold what switching the verb on \
         would cost. `store::policy::default_ceiling` grants `{Email, Internal, Web}` and no \
         calling code at all, so on the shipped ceiling `always_denies(WhatsappSend)` is true \
         twice over — the schema is not even offered to a turn — and layers only narrow, so no \
         tenant can widen it back. Deleting this entry and applying the row below would therefore \
         *not* open the verb; an operator's ceiling has to grant `Channel::Whatsapp` and a \
         calling code as well, which is a separate decision nobody has taken. What this entry \
         withholds is the tool. What the ceiling withholds is the act, and the `CallPlace` entry \
         below has always said so about voice. What is \
         left is the *closed*-window case: outside 24 hours the only legal message is a \
         pre-approved template, and this workspace has no template registry to name one from — \
         nor could it invent one, since a template is an object in a console nobody here has \
         opened. The row is therefore written out inside `catalogue` below as a free-form-only \
         tool, with the exact procedure, and is not applied: a catalogue row moves \
         `agentos_eval::toolchoice::{TRUSTED_PROMPT, UNTRUSTED_PROMPT}` and `cost::DIGEST`, whose \
         remeasurement needs a real model call that no agent may make. Applying it means deleting \
         this entry in the same commit; `catalogue_covers_every_proposable_kind` re-partitions on \

         conversation. This reason has been rewritten twice and each rewrite deleted a sentence \
         that had stopped being true. Two more go now. It is no longer the case that \
         `telephony_twilio::SILENT_TWIML` is the whole of what a callee hears: \
         `OutboundCall::says` carries an `Announcement`, the adapter renders `<Say>`, the words \
         are refused at construction if they contain markup, and the carrier's own synthesis \
         speaks them on the tenant's own account with no model of ours anywhere near it. Nor is it \
         the case that the outcome arrives on a status callback nothing accepts: \
         `TwilioTelephony::with_status_callback` points the carrier at the endpoint every text \
         message already arrives at, `CallOutcome::read` tells the two payloads apart, and \
         `inbound::land_call_outcome` files a `call_completed` audit row under the employee whose \
         `provider_intents` row named the sid. **What remains is a call that speaks once and hangs \
         up.** The callee's reply is speech, nothing in this workspace turns speech into text, and \
         a `<Gather>` would need this deployment to compose TwiML mid-call — which is the \

         row here would hand a model the power to broadcast one sentence into a stranger's ear and \
         hang up on whatever they said back, which is a robocall with a decision id. And the \
         second refusal is unchanged and would be enough on its own: \
         `store::policy::default_ceiling` grants neither `Channel::Voice` nor any calling code and \

/// The cost of being wrong about that was not one absent tool. Every one of the

/// run against the real model produced the same sentence from every seat: *I
/// have no tool that reads anything.* `proof_of_need` — the machine that turns a
/// reproducible discrepancy into evidence — was reachable only from
/// `vertical::sell`, which `loops::initiative` never calls because no `Flow` is

/// convenience; it is the only path from an employee to a page.
///
/// # Why [`BRIEF_DIRECT_REPORTS`] is the fifth and not a loop over the fourth
///
/// The bar for a new row here is that the model cannot already express the
/// thing, and when this row was written a briefing cleared it outright: the

///
/// **That half is no longer true**, and saying so is the honest thing to do
/// about a justification the code has outgrown:
/// [`SystemPrompt::with_colleagues`](crate::prompt::SystemPrompt::with_colleagues)
/// now names the reports in the prefix, from the org chart, so the addresses are
/// known. What survives is the smaller claim, and it is still enough to keep the

/// The alternative that stays rejected is the same one as before — an operator
/// listing the reports in the charter's briefing is a second copy of

/// the first time somebody is hired.
///
/// This tool reads the audience out of the org chart, server side, one link
/// down. The gate still rules once per report (see

        //
        // Unlike `issue_invoice`, which stood here written out until it was
        // applied, **the row is deliberately not written out**, and the difference between the two is the difference between
        // a measurement and a missing machine. That block is a finished tool
