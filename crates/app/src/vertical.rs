//! The wire between a role and the work: what an employee was hired to do, and
//! which vertical operation that makes due right now.
//!
//! Everything either side of this module already existed and nothing joined
//! them. [`crate::sourcing`] and [`crate::revenue`] were complete, tested and
//! called by nobody; [`crate::rolepack::RolePack::plan`] turned an
//! [`Objective`](crate::rolepack::Objective) into an ordered `Vec<Task>` that
//! nothing read. This module is the sentence in between: **the role pack's plan
//! decides the stage, and the stage names the vertical operation.**
//!
//! # A vertical operation is not an `Action`
//!
//! There were two shapes to choose from and the choice is the content of this
//! unit, so it is argued here rather than in a commit message.
//!
//! *(i)* Every vertical operation becomes an [`Action`](agentos_domain::action::Action)
//! variant: `Action::IssueRfq { … }`, ruled on by the gate, performed through
//! [`Effects`](crate::effects::Effects) holding an `Authorized<IssueRfq>`. It is
//! the consistent answer, and it is wrong for two reasons that compound.
//!
//! The first is arithmetic, and [`crate::turn`] already wrote it down: a tool
//! catalogue past roughly seventy entries is a model picking the almost-right
//! one, and `catalogue` is a fixed-size array precisely so that another entry
//! has to be argued for. Purchasing alone is six stages; sales is six more.
//! Verticalising them is twelve tool schemas for two roles, and the next two
//! roles are twelve more.
//!
//! The second is worse and is about where the blast radius actually is.
//! `issue_rfq` is N × [`Action::EmailSend`](agentos_domain::action::Action) and
//! nothing else. An `Action::IssueRfq` would be one gate decision covering N
//! recipients — so the per-recipient contact budget, the channel allowlist and
//! the suppression list would all have to be re-implemented *inside* the
//! operation, next to the copies that already live in
//! `domain::policy::evaluate`. The gate would rule once on a thing whose cost is
//! the sum of N things it did not see. Today
//! [`Buyer::issue_rfq`](crate::sourcing::Buyer::issue_rfq) authorises each
//! address on its own and returns one outcome per supplier, which is why a
//! campaign that runs out of contact budget half way comes back loudly rather
//! than quietly shrinking.
//!
//! *(ii)* — what is built here — is that a vertical operation **composes
//! existing actions**. The model is never offered an "issue RFQ" tool. The role
//! pack's plan decides that an RFQ is the next step, and the operation runs as a
//! sequence of individually-authorised effects. The gate rules on each email,
//! which is where the money and the blast radius are, and the tool catalogue
//! does not grow.
//!
//! What (ii) gives up is that the *model* cannot ask for a vertical operation.
//! That is the point. The model does the language — the RFQ's prose, the
//! qualification judgement, the reply to a supplier — and the role pack decides
//! the stage. An employee that could choose between forty verticalised tools is
//! an employee whose job description is a dropdown.
//!
//! One thing in this module *is* an `Action` variant —
//! [`Action::CharterSet`], the delegation in [`delegate`] — and the argument
//! above is exactly why it is allowed to be. It is 1 × 1 rather than 1 × N, so
//! there is no ruling covering parts the gate never saw; it decomposes into no
//! existing action, so composition would mean spelling it as something it is
//! not; and it adds nothing to the model's catalogue, because nothing turns
//! model output into one. The full reasoning is on [`delegate`].
//!
//! # No vertical operation reaches a provider without a token
//!
//! Nothing in this module touches a provider. It calls
//! [`Buyer`](crate::sourcing::Buyer), [`Seller`](crate::revenue::Seller) and
//! [`Prober`](crate::proof_of_need::Prober), each of which gates its own
//! subject and hands the resulting `Authorized<A>` to
//! [`Effects`](crate::effects::Effects) — which accepts nothing else, by
//! construction, and `tests/ui/effects_bare_action.rs` is that claim checked by
//! rustc. Adding a vertical here cannot open a second path, because there is no
//! provider handle in scope to open one with.
//!
//! # The evidence bar is a type, not a rule
//!
//! [`Prober::check`](crate::proof_of_need::Prober::check) runs a prospect's flow
//! **twice** and yields an [`Evidence`] only when the two runs agree byte for
//! byte. That suppression is the design: an unreproduced claim about another
//! company's product is a false statement about their product.
//!
//! So on this path outreach does not merely *discourage* an unevidenced
//! approach — it cannot spell one. [`Approach`] wraps the message and its only
//! constructor takes an `&Evidence`; `Evidence` in turn carries a private
//! zero-sized seal and can be built nowhere but `proof_of_need.rs`, by the
//! function that made the observation twice. There is no `Deserialize`, no
//! public constructor and no `Default` on either. Approaching a prospect this
//! employee has no reproduced finding about is a program that does not compile —
//! see `tests/ui/vertical_approach_without_evidence.rs`.
//!
//! La barre a deux moitiés et **une seule est câblée**. Une `Evidence` est un
//! *désaccord*, donc il lui faut quelque chose avec quoi être en désaccord :
//! une [`Answer`](crate::proof_of_need::Answer). Il en a existé un producteur —
//! un client MCP de l'API visa d'Orizn — et il est parti avec ce qu'il était :
//! la vérification de bout en bout du produit contre un vrai SaaS, et non un
//! morceau du produit.
//!
//! Ce que cela coûte est borné et connu. `Prober::check` prend
//! `Option<&Answer>` et sait tenir le `None` : trois des cinq constatations
//! tiennent sur la page du prospect et n'ont besoin d'aucune ligne à nous.
//! **Ce sont exactement les trois qu'un mail sortant a le droit de citer**, donc
//! la capacité d'approche est entière. Les deux qui deviennent inatteignables,
//! `Contradicts` et `StayLength`, sont exactement celles qui ne partaient jamais
//! au prospect et s'en allaient à un humain.
//!
//! # Resuming, without a scheduler
//!
//! An RFQ goes out today and is answered in three days. A turn cannot block on
//! that, and nothing here does: [`purchase`] sends and returns.
//!
//! What brings the vertical back is the machinery that already exists.
//! The supplier's reply is an inbound email; [`crate::inbound::land`] writes the
//! `messages` row and enqueues one `agent.turn.requested` outbox event, exactly
//! once, keyed on the message's idempotency key. The outbox poller dispatches
//! it, the turn recomputes the *same* plan — [`RolePack::plan`](crate::rolepack::RolePack::plan)
//! is pure — and the only thing that has changed is the material: there are
//! quotes now. [`due`] therefore answers [`Stage::Negotiate`](crate::rolepack::Stage)
//! where the previous turn was answered [`Stage::Rfq`](crate::rolepack::Stage).
//!
//! **Progress is the material, not a stored cursor.** There is no workflow row,
//! no state column and no timer, because there is nothing for them to hold that
//! the quotes and the sequences do not already say. A crash between the RFQ and
//! the reply costs nothing: the plan is recomputed and the round is re-read.
//!
//! The one thing the material cannot say is *when to stop waiting*. Silence is
//! not a row, so a round nobody answered used to read as "still waiting"
//! forever and the employee never got back to `Stage::Rfq`. The answer is the
//! deadline the RFQ already told the supplier — `rfqs.closes_at` — and
//! [`close_due_rounds`] is one `UPDATE` at the top of this turn that reads it.
//! Still no timer and still no cursor: a date the letter itself named is not a
//! scheduler. Closing the round is also the only moment a supplier's
//! responsiveness can honestly be recorded, so the same pass files the
//! `quote_returned` and `quote_missed` evidence that
//! [`shortlist`](crate::sourcing::shortlist) reads on the next round.

/// charter up on the next turn, because [`Charter::load`] is read fresh every
/// time and [`RolePack::plan`](crate::rolepack::RolePack::plan) is pure.
///
/// # Why this is an `Action` variant, when this module argues against them
///
/// The module header spends a page arguing that a vertical operation should
/// *compose* existing actions rather than become one, and the reason it gives is
/// specific: `issue_rfq` is N × [`Action::EmailSend`], so an `Action::IssueRfq`
/// would be **one ruling covering N things the gate never saw** — N recipients,
/// N contact-budget decrements, N chances for the suppression list to matter.
/// The gate would rule once on something whose cost is the sum of parts it was
/// not shown.
///
/// That reason does not apply here, and it is worth saying exactly why rather
/// than treating the earlier decision as a rule. Delegation is 1 × 1: one head,
/// one named subordinate, one row. There is no N. The gate sees the whole of it
/// — the subject is the entire subject — so there is nothing left over to be
/// re-implemented inside the operation, which is the failure the composition
/// argument was protecting against. And there is nothing to compose *out of*:
/// setting a charter is not an email, a payment or a tool call, so "compose
/// existing actions" would mean expressing it as an action it is not, which is
/// the one thing [`Action`] variants are documented never to do.
///
/// The other half of the argument — the seventy-tool ceiling — is about the
/// *model's* catalogue, and this adds nothing to it. `crate::turn`'s catalogue
/// is a fixed-size array of three, no role pack lists
/// [`ActionKind::CharterSet`] as proposable, and no code path turns model
/// output into an `Action::CharterSet`. A model cannot ask to re-task a
/// colleague; a head's own code does, and the gate rules on it.
///
/// # What authority is, and what it is not
///
/// Authority here is one link of the org chart: `subordinate` must report
/// **directly** to `head`. The gate reads that from `team_memberships` in the
/// transaction it rules in — see [`crate::gate`] — so this function does not
/// pre-check it, and could not usefully: a check here would be a second answer
/// to a question the gate already answers against fresher data.
///
/// One link and not a walk, deliberately. A CEO directs its heads, not the
/// whole company: an authority that reaches transitively is a principal that
/// can re-task every employee in the tenant, which is the single most dangerous
/// thing this design could grow. A CEO that genuinely needs to re-task somebody
/// four levels down asks the person in between, exactly as it would in a
/// company — or the operator changes the org chart, which is an audited act.
///
/// And authority is never *capability*. Being a head does not widen one number
/// in the head's own policy: the four layers the gate intersects do not include
/// the reporting line, and a Head of Sales that acquires the whole engineering
/// org still cannot call one tool its team's allowlist does not carry. The
/// tests below assert that against a real policy, not just in the domain.

/// join, its own poll cadence and its own isolated test database, to run one
/// `UPDATE`. And it would be a sweep nobody is waiting on, which is how a
/// background job rots unnoticed.
///
/// **Here**, because the employee whose round it is, is the party the stale row
/// harms: an open `rfqs` row is what stops them asking again, so *they* are the
/// one stranded by a round that never closed, and their own turn is where the
/// stranding is visible and cheap to end. It gets the initiative loop's cadence
/// for free and stays inside one tenant's transaction, so RLS is the only
/// isolation it needs. It is idempotent, so the extra cadences cost one `UPDATE`
/// matching no rows.
///
/// Its own transaction, committed before the read below: the round it just
/// closed must not be read back as one we are still waiting on.
///
/// # What closing costs, said out loud
///
/// A round that *did* get answers also ends at its deadline, so the comparison
/// ends with it and the next turn canvasses again. That is the honest reading
/// of a 14-day window — `live_quotes` already refuses prices past their
/// `valid_until`, and `due` can never reach `Sample` or `Order` on its own, so
/// the alternative is comparing the same fortnight-old quotes forever. It does
/// mean a supplier mid-conversation on day 14 is dropped mid-conversation.
///
// ponytail: no production caller advances a thread past round zero, so there is
// no conversation to be mid. When one does, the close wants a "extend rather
// than end a round with a live thread on it" clause, keyed on that table — not
// a longer constant.
//
// **This used to read "nothing drives `negotiations` in production yet", and
// that has been false since the loop was wired.** `loops::initiative` calls
// `purchasing_turn`, which calls `sourcing_store::record_rfq_recipients`, which
// opens one `negotiations` row per recipient — and `close_expired_rounds`, the
// statement two lines below this comment, is a production *reader* of the same
// table. What is still true is the narrower thing: `record_round` and
// `negotiations_awaiting_reply` have callers only in `store::sourcing`'s own
// tests, so every live row sits at `awaiting_supplier`, round zero, with
// nothing in flight. The conclusion survived its premise, which is the whole
// reason to state the premise this precisely: the trigger is a caller of
// `record_round`, not the first row in the table.

/// authorises each address on its own and [`Sequence::due`](crate::revenue::Sequence)
/// meters the spacing, so a follow-up that is too soon comes back `NotDue`
/// rather than going out.
///
/// It takes an [`Approach`], so a follow-up is subject to exactly the same
/// evidence bar as the first touch — **including the half of it that is a
/// clock**.
///
/// # Why this returns a `Result`
///
/// Because the interesting answer is the refusal. An `Approach` is a value and
/// values keep: this function's whole reason to exist is that the second touch
/// happens later than the first, and `Sequence::due` meters that spacing in
/// days, while the bar this re-asserts against is a clock. So the ordinary
/// shape of a follow-up — chase them on Thursday about what you found on Monday
/// — is exactly the shape of re-asserting a finding that expired on Tuesday, and
/// nothing here could notice, because [`Approach::new`] deliberately drops the
/// `Evidence` on the floor.
///
/// The constant that paragraph named was `MAX_TRUTH_AGE`, twenty-four hours, on
/// the authority. It is gone: what a follow-up re-asserts is
/// *"on this date your page did this"*, so the bar is
/// [`MAX_FINDING_AGE`](crate::proof_of_need::MAX_FINDING_AGE) — seven days, on
/// the observation — and `known_good_at` is the observation's instant. The
/// argument below is unchanged and the arithmetic now admits the sequence a
/// seller actually runs.
///
/// What that costs is not an embarrassment. The message names a date and then
/// says *"How to see it again"*, step by step. A prospect who follows those
/// steps and sees something else has been sent, in writing, a false statement
/// about their own product — the one mistake in this job that cannot be walked
/// back, and the reason the evidence bar is a type in the first place.
///
/// [`Checked::TruthStale`](crate::proof_of_need::Checked::TruthStale) rather
/// than a `bool` or a variant of this module's own: it is the same refusal
/// `Prober::run` makes on the same field, and [`sell`] already renders it as
/// `Sold::NoFinding(Checked::TruthStale)`. A caller holding a stale approach
/// has one correct move, and it is the expensive one on purpose — run the probe
/// again. There is no `force`.
///
/// # The alternative, and why not
///
/// The other way to close this is `follow_up(&Evidence, …)`, and it looks
/// stronger: the freshness would come from the same value the claim does, with
/// nothing copied. It does not survive contact with what an `Evidence` is. It
/// carries a screenshot, an `Untrusted<String>` of the prospect's page, and a
/// private seal that exists precisely so nothing outside `proof_of_need` can
/// construct one — so every caller that wants to chase three people on Thursday
/// would have to hold megabytes of PNG since Monday, and a `Sequence` loaded out
/// of `contacts_due_for_follow_up` could never be paired with one at all. A bar
/// that can only be met by never restarting the process is not a bar. Copying
/// one `DateTime` off the evidence at construction is what makes the check
/// available where the send is.
/// **NOT WIRED — and this paragraph is the finding, not the function.**
///
/// Nothing outside `#[cfg(test)]` calls this. That was true for a long time and
/// nothing said so, which is the same defect `SPEC.md`'s `secret_accessed`
/// promise had and `metrics::record_llm_usage` had: code a reader assumes runs
/// because it is `pub`, tested, and argued at length.
///
/// It is kept rather than deleted because it is not a mistake — it is the road
/// not taken, and the road that *was* taken is documented against it. This
/// re-sends a message that **carries the claim**, so it needs
/// `Approach::still_true`. [`due_chase`] and [`chase_message`] ship instead, and
/// they need no such bar because they make no claim at all: a chase says "we
/// wrote to you on this date", off our own `last_contacted_at` column, past
/// tense, with nothing about the prospect's page in it. There is nothing there
/// to go stale.
///
/// So the freshness check below is not a guard production is missing. It is the

///   the same spacing [`Sequence::due`](crate::revenue::Sequence) meters, read
///   off the column that survives a restart. `Sequence` cannot do it here: it

/// carries a PNG. So the question is not "how do we keep the first message's
/// claim fresh across a restart" — it is **what may a message with no evidence
/// behind it say**, and the answer is: what we did, not what their page shows.
///
/// So the body is one fact and two questions. The fact is that we wrote and
/// heard nothing — ours entirely, off `contacts.touch_count`, not off their
/// page. Everything is past tense and about the note. There is no claim, no

///

/// until [`chasing_turn`] started **claiming before sending**. `mark_contacted`
/// now writes it when the touch is claimed, and the send after it can be
/// refused by the provider — the touch is spent either way, deliberately, but
/// the column then holds a day on which nothing left the building. Quoting it
/// made the second email state a false fact about *us*, twice, in the subject
/// and in the first clause.
///
/// A truthful date needs a record of what actually went out, which is a column
/// this schema does not have. Between inventing one and dropping a sentence
/// nobody asked for, the sentence goes: "earlier" is true under every outcome
/// the claim-before-send trade can produce, and a chase whose subject is *"you
/// did not answer"* never needed a date to say so.
///
/// # The other two shapes, and why not
///
/// * **Re-probe, then chase.** The finding is re-established on today's page, so
///   the claim is current. It costs a browser run — several seconds of somebody
///   else's site, twice, for the reproduction bar — per chase, and that is the
///   smaller objection. The larger one is that it does not produce a *chase*: if
///   the page still fails, this is [`selling_turn`]'s first touch again, written
///   to somebody who has already had it; if the prospect **fixed** it, the
///   honest email is a different email nobody has written, and if the probe
///   comes back [`Checked::NotReproducible`], [`Checked::Blocked`] or
///   [`Checked::Agrees`] there is nothing to send and the turn has been spent.
///   A chase's subject is "you did not answer", which needs no browser.
/// * **Refuse to chase past [`MAX_FINDING_AGE`](crate::proof_of_need::MAX_FINDING_AGE).**
///   That is [`follow_up`]'s rule and it is the right rule *for a message that
///   re-asserts a finding*. This one does not, so the bar has nothing to
///   measure: the clause it protects is not in the body. It also fails in
///   practice — [`FOLLOW_UP_AFTER`](crate::revenue::FOLLOW_UP_AFTER) is 72 hours
///   and the bar is seven days, so the third touch lands on day 6 only if every
///   cadence fires on time and this seller had no other prospect to work that

/// It used to come after the send, on the argument that an unmarked contact is

/// beats convenient when the quiet version mails a stranger twice". The
/// priority in that sentence is right and the order did not serve it.
/// [`due_chase`] reads through
/// `loops::initiative::sales_work_for`, which **rolls its transaction back
/// before this function is called**, and
/// [`contacts_due_for_follow_up`](agentos_store::revenue::contacts_due_for_follow_up)
/// takes no lock — so the selection is a suggestion, not a claim, and two
/// replicas holding the same suggestion both reached the send. Sending first
/// and asking the ledger afterwards means the ledger's answer arrives one email
/// too late; there is no answer it can give that un-sends anything.
///
/// So: mark, commit, then send. The `UPDATE`
/// carries [`MAX_TOUCHES`](crate::revenue::MAX_TOUCHES) in its own `WHERE`, so
/// the second worker's claim matches no row, this returns the error, and no
/// second email is built. This is
/// [`agentos_store::outbox::claim_of`]'s trade taken again for the same reason
/// it was taken there — `attempt_count` is incremented at claim time, "so a
/// worker that is killed mid-handler still burns an attempt". What it costs is
/// the mirror image: a provider that fails after the claim burns a touch on an
/// email that never went out, and that prospect gets two chases instead of
/// three. Over-counting shortens a sequence; under-counting mails a stranger a
/// fourth time. Only one of those is a person's inbox.
///
/// The failure is still **returned** rather than swallowed, and the refusal is
/// now the ordinary case rather than a database fault: `NotFound` here means
/// another worker has this person, and `loops::initiative::chasing_step` spends
/// the turn on something else.
///
/// The sequence is rebuilt fresh here and is not the thing that meters anything.
/// `next_follow_up_at` is the spacing and `touch_count` is the limit, both read

    ///   emit names the binary has. What the extra literal buys is the hole
    ///   `0018`'s decision 2 named and this constraint exists to close: an
