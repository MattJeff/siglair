//! HTTP 402, read: turning a stranger's demand for money into the one thing
//! this system already knows how to refuse.
//!
//! x402 is payment over HTTP status 402. A server answers `402 Payment
//! Required` with a machine-readable body saying what it wants; the client pays
//! and replays the request with proof. **This module is the first half of the
//! client side and deliberately nothing else** — it reads the demand and stops.
//! There is no wallet here, no key, no network, no replay and no proof. See
//! [the switch](#the-switch-and-why-it-is-not-a-boolean) for the three
//! independent things holding it shut, and [the two
//! decisions](#what-blocks-this-and-the-two-decisions-only-the-founder-can-take)
//! the founder has to take before any of the rest can exist.
//!
//! # Are we the client or the server?
//!
//! Both are coherent products and they are not the same build, so the answer is
//! written down rather than assumed.
//!
//! **We are the client.** An employee that buys something at the moment it
//! needs it — a data lookup, a visa rule, a credit check — is a client paying
//! per call, and that is what every capability in this workspace points at.
//! `apps/server/src/routes/a2a.rs::SKILLS` already says so in the card a peer
//! reads: `Step::Wallet` is advertised as *"Purchasing — places orders and pays
//! for them, within its spending policy."* Places orders. Pays. Client.
//!
//! **We are not the server, and the reason is the API key.** Answering 402 to a
//! peer means selling at the call, which needs three things this build does not
//! have and should not grow speculatively: a price per method, a way to verify
//! somebody else's payment proof (a facilitator, i.e. a network call), and a
//! receipt somebody can dispute. It also has a shape problem. The JSON-RPC
//! binding is mounted **inside** the API-key layer — `a2a::router`, not
//! `a2a::card_router` — so every caller that could be charged has already been
//! issued a credential by a human, which means a commercial relationship
//! already exists and is already billed somewhere else. A 402 on a route that
//! requires a key is metering, not payment discovery; the register for that is
//! `Action::InvoiceIssue` and `migrations/0066_invoices.sql`, which is money in
//! the same direction and already built.
//!
//! So: **this module reads 402s, it never sends one.**
//!
//! # Is paying a 402 an `Action` the gate rules on, or a side effect?
//!
//! This is the question the whole module exists to answer, because getting it
//! wrong is the one way a model in this product spends money without a human
//! reading a sentence.
//!
//! **The case for "side effect".** The gate already ruled. An employee proposed
//! `Action::McpCall { tool }`, the gate allowed it, `Effects::call_tool` minted
//! a token and made the call; the server answered 402. Paying and replaying is
//! arguably just *finishing the call that was authorised*. It would need no new
//! `ActionKind`, no catalogue row, no schema, and the model would never see the
//! payment at all — which sounds like a security property.
//!
//! **The case for "an `Action`", which is the one that wins.** The token says
//! `McpCall`, and an `McpCall`'s subject is a [`McpTool`](agentos_domain::action::McpTool)
//! — a server handle and a tool handle. **It carries no amount.** Every
//! spending control in this system rules on an amount:
//! `SpendLimits::max_per_transaction`, `max_per_day`, `approval_above`, and the
//! reservation `gate.rs` takes against `spend_buckets` in the same transaction
//! as the ruling. An `McpCall` authorisation was minted without any of them
//! being consulted, because there was nothing for them to consult. Paying on
//! the strength of it means money leaves under a token no spend layer ever saw,
//! and — worse and quieter — **nothing is reserved**, so the day's running
//! total does not move and `ActionCtx::spent_today` becomes a lie for every
//! real payment that employee proposes afterwards. The structuring guard in
//! `policy::evaluate`'s `PaymentCreate` arm is built on that total. Fifty
//! side-effect 402s would walk straight past the wall
//! `fifty_small_payments_cannot_walk_past_the_daily_cap` proves is there.
//!
//! So paying a 402 is [`Action::PaymentCreate`], ruled on like any other
//! payment.
//!
//! **And it is not a new `ActionKind`.** That is a separate decision and it
//! goes the same way for the reason `Action::InvoiceIssue`'s own docs give: a
//! verb outside that enum is a verb no policy layer can withhold from a seat
//! and no role pack can decline. `PaymentCreate` already means "money leaves
//! this company"; an `X402Pay` beside it would be a *second* spelling of one
//! act, and the day the two disagreed the narrower one would be the one nobody
//! consulted — `PolicyLimits::allow_lead_upload` refuses to become an
//! `Action::LeadUpload` for exactly this reason, one field over.
//!
//! It is also free. A new kind would need a `turn::catalogue` row or a
//! `turn::UNSERVED` entry, and a catalogue row costs ~1.4k input tokens on
//! **every** model call whether or not it is used. Reusing `PaymentCreate`
//! costs nothing, because the model never proposes this at all: a 402 arrives
//! *inside* an effect that is already running, from bytes the employee never
//! asked for. There is no tool to add.
//!
//! # The switch, and why it is not a boolean
//!
//! A path built and switched off is only worth building if the off-state cannot
//! be flipped by accident. This one is held shut in three independent places,
//! and none of them is a config flag somebody can toggle:
//!
//! 1. **The taint wire.** A 402 body is a stranger's bytes by definition, so
//!    [`demand`] can only ever hand back an [`Untrusted<Demand>`].
//!    `Action::PaymentCreate` is `Risk::High`. `policy::evaluate`'s last
//!    expression denies every high-risk action derived from untrusted input
//!    with `DenyReason::UntrustedInput` — outright, with **no approval filed**,
//!    so not even a human queue is written from a stranger's number.
//!
//!    **The amount does not change the answer, and that is not free.** The wire
//!    used to read `decision.is_allow()`, which meant a demand at or above
//!    `approval_above` took the `RequireApproval` branch and was filed in the
//!    founder's queue instead — with the payee and the amount chosen by the
//!    server that sent the 402, under his own employee's name. A server that
//!    names its own price picks which branch it lands in, so a lock keyed on
//!    the amount is a lock the attacker holds the key to. Both amounts are
//!    proved below in
//!    `a_parsed_demand_is_refused_by_the_gate_whatever_the_policy`.
//!
//!    Turning this on is therefore not a code change here; it is a human
//!    looking at the challenge and re-proposing the payment from trusted
//!    ground, which is the approval flow that already exists.
//! 2. **[`PRICED_ASSETS`] is empty**, so [`demand`] refuses every real
//!    challenge before the taint wire is even reached. See below.
//! 3. **`PaymentProvider` is `NotConfigured`.** A payment an employee is
//!    *allowed* to make answers `Terminal { code: "not_configured" }` and says
//!    so in the audit trail. A **human-approved** one does not get that far:
//!    `routes::approvals::approve` asks the port before it redeems and answers
//!    `501 no_payment_rail` with the approval left `pending`, because spending a
//!    person's decision to learn what the port already knew buys nothing and
//!    cannot be undone. `crates/app/src/mocks.rs` argues why the refusal itself
//!    is worth keeping, and this module does not touch it.
//!
//! # What blocks this, and the two decisions only the founder can take
//!
//! Neither of them is a missing wallet, which is the surprise.
//!
//! **1. An x402 challenge quotes an ERC-20 contract, and [`Money`] is
//! ISO-4217.** A challenge says `asset: "0x833589f…"`, `network: "base"`,
//! `maxAmountRequired: "10000"`. Nothing in that names a currency, and the
//! number of decimals in the asset's base unit is a property of the contract,
//! not of the message. Reading `"10000"` as $0.01 or as $100.00 differs by a
//! factor of ten thousand, and picking one is inventing a number. So
//! [`PRICED_ASSETS`] is the founder's table — asset, network, currency,
//! decimals — and it ships **empty**, which is this workspace's standing rule
//! that an empty allowlist denies. It is a `const` in source rather than a row
//! in a table on purpose: a table would be writable by whoever holds a tenant
//! API key, and *"this contract is EUR with 2 decimals"* is a sentence that
//! changes what every amount in the system means.
//!
//! **2. `Money` cannot hold a sub-cent price, and x402 exists to charge
//! sub-cent prices.** `Money` is a positive integer of minor units, so the
//! smallest amount it can express is one cent. A typical x402 price is $0.001.
//! [`demand`] refuses those rather than rounding them — borrowed verbatim from
//! `Money::from_major_str`, which already rules that more decimals than the
//! currency has "is an error, not a rounding opportunity" — because rounding a
//! per-call price up to a cent is a 10× overpayment on every call and rounding
//! it down is a zero. That refusal is honest and it is also a wall: with today's
//! `Money`, this employee can pay a 402 that asks for a whole cent and nothing
//! smaller.
//!
//! Widening it is not a change to this file. `SpendLimits`, the `reserved_minor`
//! column in `spend_buckets`, every audit row and every invoice are denominated
//! in the same minor units, so the question — *does `Money` grow a sub-minor
//! representation, or is x402 used only where the price is at least one minor
//! unit?* — is a founder's decision with consequences four crates wide. It is
//! written here because here is where it first bites, and it is left open.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! No `X-PAYMENT` header, no proof encoding, no replay of the original request,
//! no facilitator client, no receipt table. All four are the *paying* half, and
//! every one of them is unreachable until the two decisions above are taken —
//! writing them now would be scaffolding whose first real use is the day
//! somebody has to re-read assumptions nobody wrote down. What is here is the
//! half that has to be right before any of that is safe: **the amount**.
//!
//! # The bridge from *a human approved* to *the money moved*
//!
//! The intended chain is *MCP call → 402 → read → `PaymentCreate` → gate →
//! budget → human approval → wallet → payment → replay → receipt*. Eight of
//! those exist now. `crates/app/tests/x402_chain.rs` runs the first seven in one
//! hand against a loopback double, from a real 402 on the wire to the approval
//! line and its hash; the eighth is `routes::approvals::approve` and its own
//! `a_replayed_approval_does_not_pay_twice`. **This section is that link, and it
//! is written here because the answer used to be spread across four files.**
//!
//! ## Link eight, and what it is
//!
//! `apps/server/src/routes/approvals.rs::approve` used to call
//! [`PolicyGate::redeem_approval`](crate::gate::PolicyGate::redeem_approval),
//! get an `Authorized<Action>` back, return its `decision_id` and **drop it** —
//! because `Authorized<Action>` satisfies no [`Effects`](crate::effects::Effects)
//! bound: every method there is `A: Subject<Of = …>`, the `subject!` macro
//! implements [`Subject`](crate::effects::Subject) for one newtype per effect,
//! and there is no `impl Subject for Action`.
//! `crates/app/tests/ui/effects_untrusted_action.rs` is the compiler holding
//! that shut and it still holds.
//!
//! What crossed it is **one arm**, which is what item 1 below always described:
//! the route destructures `Action::PaymentCreate` out of the already-parsed
//! request body into [`effects::PaymentCreate`](crate::effects::PaymentCreate),
//! redeems *that*, and hands the token to
//! [`Effects::pay`](crate::effects::Effects::pay). Every other variant takes the
//! path it always took. No new type, no new trait, no `turn::catalogue` row, and
//! no change to the hash — `PaymentCreate::to_action()` rebuilds the identical
//! variant, so a swapped payee is still `approval_action_mismatch`.
//!
//! **The thing that argument warned against is still not there, and that is why
//! this was safe to take.** The danger named was a `match` over every variant of
//! [`Action`] *from a jsonb column* to a newtype, "kept in step with the enum by
//! nothing", where the arm somebody got wrong is the arm that spends a human's
//! click on a different effect. There is no translation from jsonb here and no
//! whole-enum match: one variant, destructured from a value serde already
//! parsed, with the `else` arm unchanged. The day a second effect wants a
//! bridge, it is a second arm and the same question is asked again — which is
//! the shape that does not rot.
//!
//! `crate::sourcing::place_order` still reaches the same wall from the other
//! direction and still returns an `ApprovalId`, because *"money moves later,
//! elsewhere, through a payment the gate rules on separately"* — and this is
//! that payment's route.
//!
//! ## What it fixed, which was never the money
//!
//! `PaymentProvider` is still `NotConfigured` (see `crate::mocks`), so no money
//! moves — and this route no longer redeems to find that out, which is the
//! second thing it fixed: an approval it cannot spend is refused `501
//! no_payment_rail` and stays `pending`.
//!
//! What moved first was the ledger, and that half is about the deployments that
//! *do* have a rail. A redeemed payment approval reserves;
//! `Authorized::reservation` says the executor owes it a `spend::settle` or an
//! `org::release`, and the only code that pays that debt is
//! `Effects::book_effect`. Nothing reached it from this route, so **an approved
//! payment held the day's headroom — the seat's and its team's — until the
//! bucket rolled over at midnight**, for money that had not moved. That was
//! named here as *"the first thing a bridge has to fix, not the last"*, and it
//! is fixed: the reservation is released on the rail's refusal, in the same
//! transaction as the audit row.
//!
//! ## What is left, smallest first
//!
//! 1. ~~A typed redemption for one kind.~~ Built; see above.
//! 2. **A `PaymentProvider` that is not `NotConfigured`.** Still nothing behind
//!    the port, and choosing what goes there is a founder's decision, not an
//!    omission: §13's closing paragraph keeps the wallet design open —
//!    *customer-controlled funding source, employee wallet or delegated/session
//!    signer, small balance and strict spend ceiling, non-exportable signing
//!    key* — and a rail cannot be picked without answering it. Everything in (1)
//!    is reachable and tested without one.
//! 3. **The two decisions above** — [`PRICED_ASSETS`] and whether [`Money`]
//!    grows a sub-minor representation. Those are what make any of it reachable
//!    from a *402* rather than from a human typing an amount into a form.
//! 4. **Then, and only then, the x402-specific half**: `X-PAYMENT`, proof
//!    encoding, the facilitator, the receipt — and the replay, which is the one
//!    link nothing in this workspace has a shape for. The original `tools/call`
//!    lived inside `Effects::call_tool`, which returned long before a human
//!    looked at the queue, so "replay the request" is a **new**
//!    `Action::McpCall` ruled on again, not a resumption of the old one. Nobody
//!    has decided whether that second call is free because the payment bought
//!    it, or is its own spend against `turn::Budgets::max_tool_calls`. Written
//!    here because that is a founder's question and this is the first place it
//!    is visible.
//!
//! ## Paying once, which is the property the bridge had to carry
//!
//! `agentos-providers`' reconcile-before-create contract exists because *a
//! duplicate is the expensive mistake*, and nowhere is it more expensive than
//! here. Three things hold it, and none of them is a branch in the route:
//!
//! * **The approval row.** `approvals::redeem` moves the row out of `pending`
//!   in the transaction `redeem_approval` commits *before* `Effects::pay` is
//!   reached. A caller that crashed after the rail answered and retries the same
//!   `POST .../approve` gets `RedemptionFailure::AlreadyDecided`, and the port is
//!   never entered. That is the crash-replay guarantee, and it is a state
//!   transition rather than a comparison.
//! * **The write-ahead row.** `Effects::pay` commits a `provider_intents` row
//!   before the port is entered, so *approaches to the rail* are countable after
//!   the fact — which is what `a_replayed_approval_does_not_pay_twice` counts,
//!   and what an operator reads as `unsettled_calls` when a rail answers
//!   nothing at all.
//! * **The key.** `Effects::key_for` derives the idempotency token from the
//!   ruling, so a future adapter that reconciles before it creates has a stable
//!   string to reconcile on — which is the half of the contract only a rail can
//!   keep, and there is no rail.
//!
//! What none of them stops, said plainly: a **turn** that proposes
//! `Action::PaymentCreate` under a plain `Allow`, crashes, and is retried
//! proposes a *fresh* action with a fresh ruling and a fresh key. Nothing here
//! calls that a duplicate, and nothing should invent a rule for it — "same
//! amount, same payee, same day" is a heuristic, and a heuristic that refuses a
//! second genuine payment is worse than the loop it closes. The founder's
//! escalation threshold is what keeps that path narrow today.
