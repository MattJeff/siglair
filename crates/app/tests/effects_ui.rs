//! No side effect without a capability token, proved by the compiler.
//!
//! `crates/app/src/effects.rs` is the only code that calls a provider, and
//! every one of its methods takes an `Authorized<_>`. The claim worth testing
//! is the negative one: there is no way to send an email — or pay anybody —
//! from a bare action, and a token minted for one effect cannot be spent on
//! another. Neither program below compiles, which is the whole point; if
//! somebody later adds a convenience overload that takes an action, they start
//! compiling and this suite goes red.
//!
//! To re-record the expected errors after a compiler upgrade:
//! `TRYBUILD=overwrite cargo test -p agentos-app --test effects_ui`.

    // bare `A: Subject` today — the blanket impl gives it `Of = Action` — so a
    // bound written without its `Of =` would let a turn that read a stranger's
    // email spend the resulting ruling on any effect it liked. Nothing else in
    // this repo notices that edit; this file is the alarm.
