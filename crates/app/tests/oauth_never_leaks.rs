//! **Five secrets pass through one OAuth flow. None of them is findable
//! afterwards.**
//!
//! `agentos_app::oauth` handles, in one exchange: the deployment's
//! `client_secret`, the PKCE `code_verifier`, the `state` that lets whoever
//! holds it finish somebody's connection, the authorization `code`, and the two
//! tokens that come back. Between them they pass through an HTTP client, a URL,
//! a `Result`, two database tables and several `tracing` events, and any one of
//! those could keep a copy.
//!
//! This file is the search. After a flow completes, none of the five may be
//! findable in: the authorize URL beyond the one field that must carry it, any
//! row of `mcp_oauth_flows` or `mcp_servers`, any `Debug` rendering of the
//! registry or the error types, any log line, or the sealed ciphertext.
//!
//! # Why this is a test binary of its own
//!
//! Because it captures `tracing`, and capture is the part that is easy to get
//! silently wrong. `tracing::subscriber::set_default` is **thread-local**,
//! libtest runs a crate's unit tests in parallel across threads, and a
//! callsite's `Interest` is cached globally the first time it is evaluated. Put
//! this beside `oauth.rs`'s other thirteen tests and it passes alone and
//! captures nothing the moment a sibling reaches the same `tracing::warn!`
//! first. `model_key_never_leaks.rs` is the same file for the same reason and
//! its header carries the whole argument.
//!
//! Its own binary means its own process, one test in it, and
//! [`set_global_default`](tracing::subscriber::set_global_default) rather than a
//! thread-local guard.
//!
//! # Mutations this file is known to catch
//!
//! Break any of these and it goes red: putting the token endpoint's response
//! body into `OauthError::Endpoint`, logging `authorize_url` instead of the
//! state hash, storing the raw `state` in `mcp_oauth_flows` instead of its
//! SHA-256, storing the verifier unsealed, deriving `Debug` on `OauthClients`,
//! `Started` or `Sealed`, or echoing the `code` into any of them.

/// The five strings this exercise exists to keep out of everything.
///
/// Distinctive on purpose, and each in three independent fragments, so a
/// truncated or partial copy is caught as well as a whole one — a token with its
/// last eight characters trimmed is still a token in a log.
///
/// # Why every tail carries a `.`
///
/// The four tails used to be four hex quads — `8b21`, `3f70`, `9c4e`, `2a15` —
/// and that made this test **wrong about once in ten thousand runs**, which for
/// a leak test is the worst failure it has. `refresh_due` logs `%tenant_id` on
/// the refusal path this file deliberately drives, so the searched text always
/// contains a fresh random uuid; a uuid is thirty-two hex digits; and a four-hex
/// fragment therefore turns up in one by luck. It went red naming a log line
/// that had leaked nothing.
///
/// Everything about that is the wrong way round. The whole value of this file is
/// that nobody has ever learned to re-run it, and a test that cries wolf teaches
/// exactly that — so the fragments have to be **impossible** in the text rather
/// than merely unlikely.
///
/// A non-hex letter is not enough, and that is the trap in the obvious fix: the
/// other random text in `everything` is the `state` and the `code_challenge`,
/// base64url over `[A-Za-z0-9_-]`, which spells every letter and every digit. A
/// `.` is in neither alphabet, so a chance match stops being improbable and
/// becomes unspellable.
///
/// It also survives the wire, which is the second trap: `CLIENT_SECRET` and
/// `CODE` are asserted **byte for byte** in the form-encoded body the token
/// endpoint receives, so the character had to be one that form encoding leaves
/// alone. `.` is unreserved and comes through untouched; `~`, `+` and `!` do
/// not, and would have moved the failure into an assertion two hundred lines
/// away from the reason.
///
/// Detection is unchanged, which is the bar this had to clear: still four
/// characters, still the token's own tail, so the "log the last four for
/// debugging" leak these catch is caught exactly as before — and lowercase, so a
/// leak path that lowercases still matches, as it did.
