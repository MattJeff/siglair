//! The real Orizn MCP server, and the employee that reads it.
//!
//! Two things live here, and only the second one needs a network.
//!
//! [`ORIZN_TOOLS`] is the server's tool surface as it was actually captured, and
//! it is the reason this file is not in `src/`: nothing in the product reads it.
//! It exists so that drift is *visible* — the six names, what each one requires,
//! and the class an operator should declare each at. Everything downstream of an
//! MCP server in this workspace is keyed on tool names an operator wrote down
//! (`mcp_tool_declarations`, `PolicyLimits::allowed_mcp_tools`), so "what is
//! this server actually called and what does it actually take" is a fact the
//! repository should hold in one place rather than in six configuration files.
//!
//! The offline tests below check the parts of that fixture that do not need the
//! server: that every name survives the fold into a policy handle, that no two
//! collapse onto the same one, and that an employee granted this surface is
//! granted a *read* of it — the allowlist refuses a write tool on the visa
//! database, which is the property `RolePack::entry_requirements` exists for.
//! The one live test checks the part that does — that the fixture still
//! describes the server, and that a real question gets a real answer.

///
/// # Read this before trusting the shape of it
///
/// Three of the six do not work without an API key, and the server says so in

/// declarable — and fail at call time with no key. `compare_destinations` and
/// `check_transit_visa` need a *paid* key on top of that. So the tool inventory
/// is not the entitlement, and an employee that reads the inventory as a list of

/// route around here; it is why `crate::mcp` wraps every result in
/// `Untrusted<T>` and why the pack's briefing says an error or an empty answer
/// means Orizn has no data rather than that there is nothing to find.

/// failure the entry-requirements pack exists to prevent a repeat of.

/// # Why every one of them is `Read`

/// Not a default and not a shrug: all six only look things up. Five answer
/// questions about a passport/destination pair or a country, and the sixth

    /// schedule carries, arriving through the deployment `crate::mcp`'s module
    /// docs tell an operator to run, and parsed by the function that decides
    /// what a prospect may be told.
    ///
    /// # Why the bridge and not stdio
    ///
    /// Because that is where the key works. `https://visa.orizn.app/mcp` serves
    /// only `quick_visa_check` and ignores an API key in every header form; the
    /// **stdio** package serves all six tools and reads `ORIZN_API_KEY` from its
    /// environment. `supergateway` inherits this process's environment, so the
    /// documented arrangement is also the only arrangement in which
    /// `check_visa_requirement` answers at all — which makes the bridge not an
    /// operator's convenience but the path.
    ///
    /// # Why two pairs
    ///
    /// They are the same destination and the same schedule. `visa_fee` is
    /// `granularity: "destination"`, so both replies carry JPY 15,000 for a
    /// single entry — and only one of the two passports owes it. `CHN` → `JPN`
    /// needs a visa in advance and is billed; `FRA` → `JPN` is one of the 68+
    /// exempt nationalities the same payload's `fee_waivers` names, and quoting
    /// the number at them would be a false statement to a prospect whose
    /// business is knowing that. One live call each is what makes the refusal an
    /// observation rather than a fixture.
    ///
    /// The pairs are chosen to be dull for the reason the test above gives:
    /// Japan's visa exemption for French nationals has stood since the 1950s,
    /// and Chinese nationals have needed a Japanese visa throughout. Neither
    /// moves by ministerial notice on a Tuesday.
    ///
    /// # It needs a key, and the feature is where that is declared
    ///
    /// `live-orizn` already means "npx, the open internet, and a real server".
    /// A paid entitlement is one more precondition of the same opt-out, and the
    /// panic below names the variable rather than the value.
