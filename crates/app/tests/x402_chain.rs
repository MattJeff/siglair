//! The x402 chain, end to end, against a double — and the exact link where it
//! stops.
//!
//! The founder's chain is *MCP call → 402 → read → `PaymentCreate` → gate →
//! budget → human approval → wallet → payment → replay → receipt*. The first
//! seven links exist, and most of them have a unit test of their own — but
//! **none of them has a test that it is holding the next one's hand**, and a
//! chain is exactly the property a per-unit suite cannot see. `x402.rs` proves a
//! challenge becomes an amount, `gate.rs` proves a payment is escalated and
//! reserved, and between the two sits an `Action` nobody had ever built from a
//! real 402 body and put in front of a real database.
//!
//! "Most", not "all": link one had nothing at all. No test in this workspace
//! answers a 402 to a tool call, because the client cannot read one — see below.
//!
//! So: one run, seven assertions, one per link, each on a thing that is
//! *observable* after the fact — a status on the wire, a parsed amount, an
//! audit row, an approval row, a hash, a bucket. A chain test that only checks
//! "no error came back" would pass with the third link cut.
//!
//! # Where it stops, and why that is a decision rather than a gap
//!
//! Link seven is the last one **this file** covers, and that is now a boundary
//! rather than the end of the chain. Link eight exists —
//! `apps/server/src/routes/approvals.rs::approve` redeems a `payment_create`
//! into a typed subject and calls `Effects::pay` — and it is tested where it
//! lives, in that route's `a_replayed_approval_does_not_pay_twice`, because it
//! is an HTTP handler in the binary and this is a crate test in `agentos-app`.
//! What it reaches is a port with nothing behind it, so the money still does not
//! move. `crates/app/src/x402.rs`'s *"The bridge from a human approved to the
//! money moved"* is the single place that argues all of it; this file does not
//! repeat it. The three links past eight (payment, replay, receipt) are blocked
//! on the wallet decision and on the two decisions about money that only the
//! founder can take.
//!
//! # Why the wire is dialled with `reqwest` and not with the MCP client
//!
//! `crate::mcp::Fleet` cannot hand a 402 body to anybody, and that is written
//! down at length in `mcp::refused_the_credential`: `rmcp` 3.1.4 is built
//! against reqwest 0.13 and this workspace against 0.12, so the status cannot
//! be downcast out of the transport error and a 402 arrives as an opaque,
//! *retryable* failure with the body already thrown away. Routing this test
//! through `Fleet` would therefore prove the chain is broken at link one for a
//! reason that is a `Cargo.lock` rather than this product. It is dialled with
//! the workspace's own client instead — the same 0.12 `reqwest` that
//! `peer_keys` reads a stranger's document with — which is what `Fleet` becomes
//! the day the two versions agree.
//!
//! What that costs, named rather than hidden: this file does not prove the MCP
//! client surfaces a 402. Nothing does, because it does not.
//!
//! # No money moves and no key exists
//!
//! The server is a `TcpListener` on loopback that answers one JSON-RPC request
//! with a 402. `PRICED_ASSETS` stays empty in the shipped code; the asset table
//! below is this test's own, exactly as `x402.rs`'s own tests build theirs.
