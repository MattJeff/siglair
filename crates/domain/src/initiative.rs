//! When an employee is allowed to act on its own.
//!
//! Until now a turn happened only because something arrived — an email, an A2A
//! request, a webhook. That was the throttle, and it was a good one: no traffic,
//! no cost. An employee hired with an objective sat there.
//!
//! This module is the other half. It answers one question, purely:
//! *may this employee start a turn of its own right now?* It does not decide
//! what the employee should do — that is the role pack's `plan`, recomputed per
//! turn and stored nowhere — and it does not decide whether the employee can
//! afford to, which is the turn budget in [`crate::policy`].
//!
//! # Why the schedule is stored rather than computed
//!
//! The obvious design is `last_acted_at + cadence <= now`. It is wrong in a way
//! that only shows up in production: an employee suspended for a week comes back
//! owing a week of turns, and every employee created in the same import is due
//! in the same instant forever. Storing an explicit `next_at` that is **set from
//! `now` when the turn is taken up** makes the schedule a promise about the
//! future rather than a debt from the past. A missed slot is missed, not queued.
//!
//! Taking the turn up is also what writes the new deadline, in the same
//! statement, which is what the outbox poller does with its retry backoff and
//! for the same reason. A schedule that only moved on success would leave a
//! crashed turn permanently due, and the loop would pick it up again at once.
//!
//! That is the difference between a cron and "do it again in a while", and for
//! an employee the second is what anyone actually means. Nobody wants the
//! purchasing agent to do eight hours of thinking at once because the server was
//! down.
//!
//! # Jitter is an argument, not a call to a random number generator
//!
//! Ten employees created by one script share a creation timestamp, so they share
//! every subsequent deadline, and they hit the model provider together forever.
//! The fix is to spread the first schedule — but this crate has no `rand` and
//! should not grow one, because a pure function that reaches for entropy cannot
//! be tested by stating what it returns. So [`Cadence::advance`] takes the
//! offset as a parameter and the caller draws it.
