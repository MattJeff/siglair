//! Pure domain: types, the employee state machine, and the Policy Gate evaluator.
//!
//! This crate performs no I/O. It has no tokio, sqlx, reqwest or async-trait
//! dependency, and that absence is the enforcement mechanism: a business rule
//! physically cannot reach the network or the database from here.
//!
//! Module owners are fixed so that units can be built in parallel without two
//! of them editing the same file.
