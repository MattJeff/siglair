//! **Whose model the tenant thinks with, and by what path** — a resource the
//! tenant owns, deliberately not a policy field.
//!
//! # Why this is not in [`PolicyLimits`]
//!
//! [`PolicyLimits::allowed_models`] already exists and already answers a
//! question about models, so the cheap move would have been one more field
//! beside it. It is the wrong move, and the reason is what a policy field *is*:
//! something that intersects across platform ∧ tenant ∧ role ∧ employee, where
//! empty denies and a lower layer can only narrow. Run this shape over "by what
//! path does this tenant reach a model" and every part of it reads wrong:
//!
//! * **There is nothing to intersect.** `{ApiKey} ∧ {Cli}` is the empty set, and
//!   the empty set means *deny* everywhere else in [`PolicyLimits`]. So a
//!   platform layer saying "API key" and a tenant saying "CLI" would produce a
//!   tenant that cannot think at all — not because anybody withheld anything but
//!   because two layers described the same tenant's plumbing differently.
//! * **A narrowing has no meaning here.** A role layer cannot sensibly say "this
//!   seat reaches the model by a *narrower* path than the tenant does". There is
//!   one path per tenant, because there is one credential per tenant.
//! * **Policy is written by an operator; this is stamped by the system.**
//!   [`ModelAccess::verified_at`] is a fact we observed by making a call. An
//!   operator cannot type it, and a layer document that could would be a
//!   document that asserts a key works.
//!
//! So it is a row the tenant owns, and since
//! `migrations/0050_tenant_model_key.sql` the credential is a sealed column on
//! that same row rather than an entry in a store somewhere else. There is no
//! pointer at all — not a stored one and not a derived one — which is the
//! strongest form of "no column anybody can edit to make one tenant's row reach
//! another tenant's key". The AES-GCM additional data is the tenant's own id, so
//! a blob moved between rows decrypts to nothing.
//!
//! # What this deliberately cannot do
//!
//! **It cannot widen [`PolicyLimits::allowed_models`].** Not "it is checked not
//! to" — it has no path to. [`ModelAccess`] holds a [`ModelId`] and that field
//! is the model whose reachability *was proven with this credential*, which is a
//! fact about the key and not a permission. Which model a turn actually runs is
//! still [`model_for`] over the four intersected layers, and it is the only
//! answer to that question in the workspace. A tenant that connects a key for
//! Opus under a policy that permits only Haiku runs Haiku — see
//! `agentos_app::model_access` for what that costs.
//!
//! [`PolicyLimits`]: crate::policy::PolicyLimits
