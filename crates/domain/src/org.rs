//! Teams and sections: an owner for the `role` layer of the policy stack.
//!
//! One tenant runs several teams at once — purchasing, sales, regulatory
//! watch, support. They share a tenant, a database and a runtime, and the only
//! thing that keeps them from colliding is that each one owns a policy layer
//! and a tool allowlist of its own. This module is that ownership, and nothing
//! more: no new policy mechanism, no second evaluator. A [`Team`] holds a
//! [`PolicyLimits`] and hands it to [`EffectivePolicy::try_new`] as the `role`
//! argument, exactly where `crates/store/src/policy.rs` already looks for it.
//!
//! Three rules carry over from [`crate::policy`] and are not re-litigated here:
//!
//! * **Lower layers only tighten.** Every combination in this file goes
//!   through [`EffectivePolicy`], so a team physically cannot widen its
//!   tenant, and a section cannot widen its team.
//! * **An absent layer inherits the layer above.** An employee in no team gets
//!   `None` from [`role_layer`], which the caller resolves to the tenant
//!   layer — never `PolicyLimits::default()`, which grants nothing and would
//!   turn "this team wrote no rule" into "this team may do nothing".
//! * **A named team that does not exist is an error, not an absent layer.**
//!   Silently dropping a membership would drop the restriction it carries.
//!
//! # Why an employee may belong to several teams, and what that costs it
//!
//! It may. A support employee covering two product lines is the ordinary case,
//! and forbidding it would push people into inventing a third team that is the
//! union of two — which is the escalation this design exists to prevent.
//!
//! The price is that memberships **intersect**, never union: an employee in
//! purchasing and sales may do what *both* teams allow, which for disjoint
//! tool allowlists is nothing at all. That is the safe direction and it is
//! deliberate. Joining a second team is a way to lose reach, never to gain it.
//!
//! # The tool ceiling is a type error, not a convention
//!
//! A sibling project measured the ceiling in practice: past roughly 73 tools
//! the model stops choosing well — it hesitates between two neighbours, picks
//! the almost-right one, or redoes by hand what a tool covered. The failure
//! mode is not an exception, it is a quietly worse employee. So the allowlist
//! is per team, [`Team::MAX_TOOLS_PER_EMPLOYEE`] is checked at construction,
//! and the count is readable via [`Team::tool_count`]. Because memberships
//! intersect, a team that is under the ceiling keeps every one of its members
//! under it too, however many teams the company grows.
//!
//! # A [`Mission`] is prose, and prose is still parsed
//!
//! The third column of an operator's org chart — *what this function is for* —
//! is a [`Mission`]: one durable sentence per team, so that a new employee has
//! something to be told beyond its own task. It carries no limit and grants
//! nothing; every restriction is still a [`PolicyLimits`] field.
//!
//! It is a type and not a `String` for one reason, and it is the same reason
//! `employee_charters.objective` is re-parsed rather than deserialised:
//! [`Mission::parse`] is the only constructor, there is no `Deserialize`, and
//! `store::org::mission` runs the text from the column back through it on every
//! read. A mission that comes back from the database unparsed is a mission that
//! can say anything — including a control character or a screenful of somebody
//! else's instructions, in a string that ends up in a system prompt.
//!
//! # Seniority is not a capability, and cannot become one
//!
//! The org chart grew a reporting line in `0027_positions`, and that is the one
//! place a hierarchy could have gone wrong: "senior" quietly meaning "more
//! permissions". It cannot here, and the reason is structural rather than
//! careful.
//!
//! [`EffectivePolicy::try_new`] takes exactly four layers — platform, tenant,
//! role, employee — and this module never offers it a fifth. There is no
//! `reports_to` in [`PolicyLimits`], no `is_head` anywhere, and
//! [`role_layer`] resolves a team from a [`Membership`], never from a manager.
//! A head's limits are the limits of the team it is on, computed by the same
//! intersection as everyone else's; gaining a report changes no input to that
//! computation, so a Head of Sales does not acquire the CTO's tools by being
//! senior to somebody. What a reporting line decides is *whom this employee may
//! direct* — a set of employees, never a set of capabilities — and that is
//! checked outside the policy stack entirely (`app::vertical::delegate`).
