//! Which way a deployment gets numbers for its employees.
//!
//! # Why a pool exists
//!
//! One regulated FR number per employee means up to one hundred French
//! regulatory bundles, each needing a French address and a proof of address
//! dated within three months, each reviewed by a human. That cost is
//! provider-independent — it is the regulator's, not Twilio's. Five to ten
//! shared numbers with per-employee routing removes more work than any vendor
//! switch, which is why pooling is what makes onboarding a hundred employees
//! possible at all rather than a way to shave the bill.
//!
//! A US number needs no bundle, and a dedicated number is a better identity
//! where it is free, so pooling is a [`NumberStrategy`], not a replacement.
//! Both strategies answer the same contract: the employee has a number to send
//! from, and an inbound message reaches exactly one employee.
//!
//! # Why the pool's own rules are not in this crate
//!
//! They used to be: this module carried `PoolNumber`, `Allocation`,
//! `CounterpartyAffinity`, `PoolError`, and pure `allocate` / `route_inbound`
//! functions over slices of them, with a proptest asserting the decisions did
//! not depend on row order. Nothing outside `#[cfg(test)]` ever called any of
//! it, and the reason is structural rather than an oversight: **both decisions
//! have to be atomic against concurrent workers, so both are made by the
//! database.**
//!
//! * Allocation is `agentos_store::phone_pool::allocate_atomic`, whose
//!   `number_allocations_live_employee_region_key` refuses a second live seat
//!   even to a worker that raced past a pure check. A `Vec<Allocation>` read a
//!   moment earlier cannot make that promise.
//! * Inbound routing is `agentos_app::inbound::resolve_phone_recipient`, one
//!   `ORDER BY` over `employee_resources` joined to `conversations`. The
//!   affinity it reads is the `conversations` row the landing transaction has
//!   already written, so there is no second table to keep in step — which is
//!   the other half of why the pure version never shipped. Since
//!   `0069_a_number_is_an_endpoint_too` that lander runs on a real webhook, so
//!   an over-allocated pooled number would no longer be a row too many in a
//!   table — it would be a supplier's message landing on the colleague who was
//!   allocated first. (Would, not does: `EngineConfig::default()` is
//!   [`NumberStrategy::Dedicated`] with `provision_phone: false`, so nothing in
//!   the shipped server allocates a pooled slot yet.)
//!
//! The pure functions were deleted along with a `counterparty_affinity` table
//! nothing writes. Their arguments live on where the shipped code makes the
//! same decisions; the tie-breaks are documented on
//! `resolve_phone_recipient` and on `allocate_atomic`.
