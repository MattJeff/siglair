//! The policy gate: the one place that decides whether a side effect happens.
//!
//! Two structural commitments, both of which the previous implementation
//! violated and both of which are now enforced by the compiler:
//!
//! 1. **No default-open fallthrough.** [`evaluate`] matches every [`Action`]
//!    variant by name. There is no `_` arm, so the day a seventeenth action is
//!    added the build breaks instead of the action being silently permitted.
//!    The old code ended in `_ => PolicyDecision::Allow`, which is how
//!    "sign this contract" became a thing an employee could do unsupervised.
//! 2. **No policy field the evaluator forgot.** [`evaluate`] destructures
//!    [`PolicyLimits`] field by field with no `..`, so adding a limit that
//!    nothing consults is a compile error, not a silent no-op.
//!
//! Layers combine by **intersection**: platform ∧ tenant ∧ role ∧ employee.
//! Allowlists intersect, denylists union, numeric caps take the minimum,
//! permission flags take the logical AND. A tenant therefore cannot widen a
//! platform limit — the only direction a lower layer can move is tighter.
//!
//! The empty [`PolicyLimits`] grants nothing, so an unconfigured system denies
//! everything. Deny by default is a property of the data, not a rule in the
//! evaluator that someone can forget to write.
//!
//! # The turn budget
//!
//! [`PolicyLimits::max_turns_per_day`] is the one limit here that is *not* an
//! [`Action`], and it exists because every other limit is on money or on tool
//! calls inside one turn. An employee that wakes on a cadence, thinks, reads
//! and writes without ever proposing a payment trips none of them while
//! burning model tokens continuously. Until an initiative loop existed the
//! natural throttle was that a turn only happened when somebody sent something;
//! a loop removes it, so the ceiling has to be written down.
//!
//! It is intersected exactly like the numeric caps — the minimum across
//! platform ∧ tenant ∧ role ∧ employee, so a team can only tighten it — but it
//! is read by [`turns_remaining`] rather than by [`evaluate`], because there is
//! no `Action::TakeTurn` and inventing one would put a non-effect into the
//! audit vocabulary, the tool catalogue and the taint wire for no gain.
//!
//! **Turns, not tokens.** A token cap is the honest unit of an LLM bill and we
//! cannot enforce it: the provider counts tokens, and no reliable count exists
//! *before* the call — which is the only moment a cap can refuse anything. A
//! turn is the thing we can refuse before it costs money, so turns are the
//! proxy, and the multiplier from turns to currency lives outside this
//! workspace with the rate card.
//!
//! # The model allowlist
//!
//! [`PolicyLimits::allowed_models`] is the second limit here that is not an
//! [`Action`], and it is here for the turn budget's reason: the two largest
//! levers on an LLM bill are *how often* an employee thinks and *what it thinks
//! with*, and an operator who can bound one and not the other can only bound
//! half the money. It intersects like every other allowlist — a lower layer
//! narrows, never widens — and [`model_for`] is its evaluator, asked once when a
//! turn is assembled rather than once per action, because a model cannot change
//! inside a turn.
//!
//! The multiplier from a model to currency lives outside this workspace with the
//! rate card, exactly as the multiplier from turns does. What is in here is the
//! *permission*, and the domain deliberately holds no price: `ModelId`'s ordering
//! encodes which models cost more than which, and nothing else.
