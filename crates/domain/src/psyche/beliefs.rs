//! Episodic journal → consolidated beliefs, with the founding facts kept.
//!
//! Ported from MPCP (`mpcp.py`: the journal built in `ingest`, `_consolider`,
//! and `pourquoi`). The memory ontology is Tulving's: the journal is
//! **episodic** (raw recorded facts), the beliefs are **semantic** ("Acme
//! quotes above their final price"). The compression from one to the other is
//! two-speed hippocampus→neocortex consolidation (Squire; Diekelmann & Born):
//! isolated episodes dilute, `N` concordant ones become a durable belief that
//! keeps pushing after the episodes stop being interesting.
//!
//! # NOT WIRED — nothing outside `#[cfg(test)]` uses this module
//!
//! `grep -rn 'beliefs::\|BeliefJournal\|consolidate' apps crates` finds this
//! file and its own tests. `agentos_store::psyche::consolidate_belief` has no
//! caller either, so `psyche_beliefs` and `psyche_belief_episodes` are tables
//! nothing writes.
//!
//! Deliberate, and the argument is in `agentos_app::psyche`'s closing section:
//! the only subject with `N_CONSOLIDATION` concordant episodes in this product
//! is "slow to answer", which is the expectation restated, and a belief that
//! adds no information is a second place for the same fact to be wrong. What
//! is missing is not the code below — it is an employee that observes a lead
//! time missed or a spec substituted.
//!
//! So read the section below as the specification it is. It describes what a
//! belief *would* mean here, not a judgement any employee is forming today.
//!
//! # What this is for
//!
//! A purchasing agent's moat is what it accumulates about suppliers. This
//! module is the part that makes an accumulated judgement *defensible*:
//! [`BeliefJournal::why`] walks a belief back to the exact episodes that
//! created it, so a human reviewing a purchase order can read why the agent
//! distrusts a supplier instead of reading an opaque score.
//!
//! # The governing invariant
//!
//! **Beliefs influence TONE and PRIORITISATION, never AUTHORISATION.** Nothing
//! in this module is an input to `crate::policy::evaluate`, and it must never
//! become one. A belief may decide whom to chase first, what to propose, and
//! how to phrase it. If a belief could widen a permission, a frustrated agent
//! would accept a price it would have refused calm, and the Policy Gate's
//! guarantee — pure function of policy and action — would be gone. MPCP states
//! the same rule for itself: *"l'identité ne colore QUE le ressenti, jamais la
//! dynamique — pas de prophétie auto-réalisatrice câblée."*
//!
//! # Deliberate omissions
//!
//! * **Episodes are immutable.** Real memory reconsolidates: recalling a fact
//!   rewrites it (Loftus; Nader). MPCP omits reconsolidation on purpose and
//!   says so (`FONDEMENTS_SCIENTIFIQUES.md`: *"Journal immuable / pas de
//!   reconsolidation — arbitrage réalisme ↔ replay bit-à-bit"*). We keep that
//!   trade: an episode, once recorded, never changes, so a purchase order's
//!   provenance reads the same a year later as it did the day it was written.
//!   The two mutable flags MPCP writes back onto its journal entries
//!   (`consolide`, `resolu`) live here in side sets on the journal, so
//!   [`Episode`] itself is genuinely write-once.
//! * **No journal compaction.** MPCP's `_compacter_journal` evicts old resolved
//!   non-founding entries because a village of NPCs is RAM-bound in a game
//!   loop. Here the journal is persisted; pruning is the store's problem, and
//!   never pruning is what makes "a belief always has its episodes" an
//!   invariant rather than an aspiration.
//! * **No hearsay narratives, no theory of mind.** MPCP's `récits` (a belief
//!   that travels between NPCs and counts for several episodes) and its
//!   sixteen modelled minds are out of scope for a B2B purchasing agent.
//!   Consequently `n_eff` is simply the number of episodes in the group.
