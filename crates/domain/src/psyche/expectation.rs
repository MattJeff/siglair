//! P3 — learned expectation and prediction error (Rescorla-Wagner + Welford).
//!
//! This is the accumulator that turns thousands of dull interactions into the
//! only asset a purchasing agent really owns: *what this counterparty actually
//! does, as opposed to what it says it does.*
//!
//! ```text
//!   supplier Z claims a 15-day lead time      -> Expectation::with_claim(15.0)
//!   deliveries land at 22, 24, 23, 23 days    -> observe(...)
//!   expected() converges on ~23, claim_gap() = +8, reliability() = Predictable
//! ```
//!
//! Two mechanisms, both ported from MPCP (`mpcp.py`), both textbook:
//!
//! * **Rescorla-Wagner (1972)** — `expected += rate * (observed - expected)`.
//!   Learning is proportional to surprise, so habituation is not a patch: the
//!   hundredth on-time delivery moves nothing, the first late one moves a lot.
//! * **Welford's online variance** — how *reliable* the counterparty is. A
//!   supplier that is consistently eight days late is more usable than one that
//!   is randomly zero to thirty days late, and only the variance tells them
//!   apart. Welford is used rather than the naive sum-of-squares because the
//!   naive form loses catastrophic precision on a large mean (see the
//!   `welford_survives_a_large_offset` test).
//! * **Precision-weighted gain (Feldman & Friston)** — the learning rate is
//!   scaled by `1 / (1 + K · variance)`, so one datapoint from an erratic
//!   counterparty moves the belief less than one datapoint from a metronome.
//!
//! # The governing invariant
//!
//! Everything here is READ-ONLY advice for *tone and prioritisation*: what to
//! propose, whom to chase first, how to phrase it. None of it may ever be an
//! input to [`crate::policy::evaluate`]. A frustrated or a surprised agent must
//! be allowed exactly the same set of actions as a calm one — the moment an
//! expectation can widen a permission, the Policy Gate stops being a pure
//! function of the policy and the action, and the safety story is gone.
//!
//! # Determinism
//!
//! No clock is read here (`now` is a parameter), there is no randomness, and
//! the book is a [`BTreeMap`], so iteration and serialization are byte-stable.
//! Non-finite floats cannot enter the state: they are rejected at `observe`,
//! and deserialization funnels through a validating wire type.
