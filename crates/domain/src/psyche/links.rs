//! Relational trust: links built and broken, one per counterparty.
//!
//! Port of MPCP's `liens` (`mpcp.py`: `LIEN_DELTAS`, `_bouger_lien` inside
//! `ingest`, `_appraisal`), retargeted to suppliers.
//!
//! # What the model says
//!
//! * **Trust is earned, never assigned.** [`TrustLink::confidence`] starts at
//!   [`BASE_CONFIDENCE`] and only ever moves through [`TrustLedger::record`].
//!   There is no setter, and no constructor that takes a confidence.
//! * **A built link absorbs a first blow.** The shock absorber
//!   ([`SHOCK_ABSORBER`], MPCP `AMORTI_LIEN = 0.85`) is a Bayesian prior: three
//!   years of on-time deliveries are evidence, and one bad shipment does not
//!   erase them. Each blow weakens the absorber for the next one, so doubt
//!   installs itself and *then* kills.
//! * **Breakage needs something to break.** A collapse only marks a rupture if
//!   the confidence was actually built ([`BREAKABLE_FROM`], MPCP
//!   `CONFIANCE_BRISABLE = 0.6`) — this is Berg's trust-game asymmetry: a cold
//!   counterparty cannot betray you.
//! * **Betrayal by someone close hits twice as hard.** [`Appraisal`] weighs the
//!   *same* event by the standing of the relationship: ×2 from a close partner,
//!   ×0.5 from one already distrusted ("that figures"), ×1.5 for unexpected
//!   decency from a distrusted one. This is Kahneman–Tversky loss aversion
//!   (λ≈2) applied relationally, and it is MPCP's `_appraisal` unchanged.
//! * **Breakage is structural.** [`TrustLink::broken_at`] is set once and never
//!   cleared: a scar, not a mood. Later kept promises still raise confidence,
//!   but the link stays visibly broken and can never read as `Close` again.
//!
//! # NOT WIRED — only [`BASE_CONFIDENCE`] is read outside `#[cfg(test)]`
//!
//! `grep -rn 'TrustLedger\|TrustEvent\|appraise' apps crates` finds this file,
//! `apps/server/tests/sourcing_e2e.rs`, and nothing else. The ledger, the
//! events, the shock absorber and the appraisal are exercised by their tests
//! and by no caller.
//!
//! That is a decision, not a gap, and the argument is written down once in
//! `agentos_app::psyche`'s closing section: a [`TrustEvent`] is a commitment
//! whose fulfilment we watched, and this product has no purchase order, no
//! shipment and no inspection — so there is no honest event to feed it.
//! `agentos_app::psyche` writes two timestamps to `psyche_trust` ("we are
//! waiting since", "they last spoke at") and leaves `trust` on
//! [`BASE_CONFIDENCE`], which is what `psyche_trust_needs_evidence` permits and
//! what an opinion with no evidence behind it should look like.
//!
//! Read the rest of this header as a specification of what happens the day
//! those events exist, not as a description of what runs today.
//!
//! # Where this may and may not be used
//!
//! Trust ranks the queue and colours the wording. It is never an input to
//! [`crate::policy::evaluate`]. A supplier at 0.95 gets no permission a
//! supplier at 0.05 lacks.
