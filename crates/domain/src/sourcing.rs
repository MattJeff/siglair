//! The buyer vocabulary: suppliers, RFQs, quotes and the negotiation machine.
//!
//! Four things are carried by the type system rather than by review, because
//! each of them is a mistake a buyer makes exactly once:
//!
//! * **Reputation is observed, never typed in.** [`Reputation`] has no public
//!   fields, no setter, no `Deserialize` and no constructor that takes a score.
//!   The only way to get one is [`Reputation::observed`], folded over a
//!   supplier's [`Evidence`] log. What is stored is the evidence; the number is
//!   derived on read, exactly like [`crate::employee::Health`]. A "4.5 stars"
//!   column somebody's intern edited is not a state this type can reach.
//! * **An expired quote is a different type from a live one.** [`Quote`] cannot
//!   be accepted; [`LiveQuote`] can, and the only way to make one is
//!   [`Quote::live_at`] with an explicit `now`. Acceptance of a stale price is
//!   not a runtime check you can forget — it is a value you cannot build.
//! * **Currency is not decoration.** A CNY quote and a EUR target do not
//!   compare. [`Quote::meets_target`] needs an [`ExchangeRate`] for the exact
//!   pair, and says [`SourcingError::MissingRate`] when it does not have one.
//!   Neither do a FOB quote and a DDP target: the freight is not in the same
//!   price, so differing incoterms are a typed error too.
//! * **Supplier text is data.** Every byte a supplier authored — its name, its
//!   spec sheet, its reply — stays [`Untrusted`]. A [`SupplierMessage`] is an
//!   *inbound* [`CanonicalMessage`] pinned to a supplier and a round; the
//!   constructor rejects an outbound one, so our own sent text can never be
//!   re-read as the supplier's answer.
//!
//! Nothing here reads the clock, opens a socket or touches a row. Every
//! function that needs the time takes `now`.
