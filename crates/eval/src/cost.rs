//! **What Orizn costs a month, computed once, from a run that happened.**
//!
//! # The problem this module exists for
//!
//! `docs/ORIZN.md` published **≈$76 a month**. It was arithmetic over three
//! numbers: 4,639 input tokens per model call, an assumed 600 output tokens, and
//! **one model call per reserved turn**. The first was measured by
//! [`crate::scoping`] and then moved; the second was a guess; the third was the
//! *floor* of a range that runs to ten, quoted as if it were an estimate. When
//! somebody finally ran the thing and counted, all three were wrong in the same
//! direction and the honest figure was several times what the document said.
//!
//! None of that was a bug. It is what happens when a number is typed into prose:
//! prose cannot be re-run, so it is right on the day it is written and drifts
//! silently forever after. This module is the fix, and it is small:
//!
//! * the arithmetic is [`Sample::usd`], one function, unit-tested — and it lives
//!   in [`agentos_domain::forecast`] now, because `apps/server`'s `/v1/forecast`
//!   prices the asking tenant's own seats with the same one;
//! * the inputs are [`RECORDED`] — the samples a real `--dry-run` printed;
//! * the turns column is read out of `docs/orizn-roles/*.json`, the operator's
//!   own documents, rather than restated;
//! * and [`headline`] is the sentence. `docs/ORIZN.md` must contain it
//!   **verbatim**, which is what the `the runbook quotes this measurement` row
//!   below gates on. Change the measurement and the document goes red until
//!   somebody pastes the new sentence in. There is no second copy to forget.
//!
//! # A range, not a point
//!
//! `max_turns_per_day` counts *reserved turns*; one reserved turn makes between
//! one and [`Budgets::max_turns`] = ten model calls, each re-sending the whole
//! prefix. So the bill is a range an order of magnitude wide and any point
//! estimate inside it is a choice. The document used to publish the floor
//! without saying so. [`headline`] publishes all three: the floor, what was
//! measured, and the ceiling.
//!
//! # Why the numbers are recorded and not asserted
//!
//! A live run is a sample from a model. A threshold test on a sample is a flaky
//! test, and a flaky test gets deleted — so nothing here asserts that the bill is
//! under anything. What is gated is the same thing [`crate::toolchoice`] gates:
//! **the question these numbers answered**. [`DIGEST`] pins the three charters'
//! rendered prompts, their plans, the turn brief and the five operator documents.
//! Edit any of them and this suite goes red with *"the recorded run measured a
//! different company"*, which is true, and the fix is to re-run `--dry-run` and
//! re-paste. The deterministic half's job is to **invalidate** the live numbers,
//! never to fabricate them.
//!
//! # What is not in here
//!
//! Prompt caching, which lowers it; the provisioning loop's own model calls,
//! which raise it; and the difference between the `claude` CLI shim the dry run
//! drives and `llm_anthropic`, which is the production path. All three are in
//! `unmeasured` below with the direction they move the number.

// That instruction got weaker when the array moved, and pretending otherwise
// would be the failure this file exists to prevent — it is now possible to edit
// the samples without opening this file at all. What still holds is the half
// that was ever mechanical: `digest` fails the suite when the *company* those
// samples measured changes. Nothing anywhere catches a hand-typed sample, and
// nothing ever did.
//
// The samples in it are the first taken with the seller actually selling. The
// three before them were taken while `dryrun::take_turn` omitted the vertical
// step entirely — the sales seat had no prospect, so `vertical::due_prospect`
// would have answered `None`, and what the sample recorded for that seat was an
// ordinary conversational turn. The seller now runs a confirmed prospect's
// booking flow twice, files a finding and has its approach refused by
// `max_new_contacts_per_day` before the model generates a token. See `Prospect`
// and `dryrun`'s module docs.
//
