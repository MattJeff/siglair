//! Does the psyche predict a supplier's real behaviour better than the
//! supplier's own claim?
//!
//! **That comparison is the whole evaluation.** A learned expectation that
//! predicts worse than the brochure is not a weak feature, it is a liability
//! with a maintenance cost, and the only responsible thing to do with it is
//! delete it. So every series here is scored twice — once for
//! [`Expectation`], once for a predictor that simply believes `claimed`
//! forever — and the two numbers are printed side by side.
//!
//! # Method: fixtures, measured against the eventual truth
//!
//! [`Expectation::observe`] takes its clock as a parameter and has no
//! randomness, so a series replays bit for bit. The metric is **one-step-ahead
//! absolute error**: before each observation, ask both predictors what the next
//! delivery will be; after it, record how far each was wrong. Mean over the
//! series. This is what a buyer actually experiences — every delivery is a
//! prediction they made a plan against.
//!
//! # Where the ground truth comes from. Read this before believing a number.
//!
//! **The observations are the truth for their series, by construction.** Given
//! `[22, 24, 23]`, "which predictor was closer" is arithmetic, not opinion.
//! That part is [`Truth::Correct`].
//!
//! **The series themselves are hand-written archetypes, not real supplier
//! data.** We have no delivery history. So:
//!
//! * The **per-archetype verdicts are meaningful and are asserted**: on a
//!   supplier who is consistently eight days late, a learner that does not
//!   beat the brochure is broken, and that is true whatever the real world
//!   looks like.
//! * The **aggregate is a characterisation and is labelled as one**, because it
//!   is a weighted average over a mix of archetypes nobody has measured. If
//!   real suppliers are 90% `HONEST`, the aggregate below is flattering by a
//!   wide margin.
//!
//! The archetypes were chosen so the suite can *lose*. A corpus of nothing but
//! liars would let any learner look brilliant; [`Series::HONEST`] and
//! [`Series::ERRATIC`] are the two where the psyche is expected to be *worse*
//! than the claim, and they carry the tightest bars in the file. An eval you
//! cannot fail is a slogan.
