//! Evaluation: does the employee do good work?
//!
//! The suite in this workspace proves the code is correct. None of it asks
//! whether `rank` orders quotes the way a buyer would, whether the psyche
//! predicts better than the brochure, or how many true findings the
//! proof-of-need bar throws away. This crate asks those four questions and
//! nothing else.
//!
//! # A crate, not an `evals/` directory of JSON
//!
//! The things being measured are Rust values with no wire format, deliberately:
//! [`Evidence`](agentos_app::proof_of_need::Evidence) is not `Deserialize`
//! because an evidence that can be parsed from JSON will one day be parsed from
//! model output; `Landed` has one constructor; `Quote` has one constructor and
//! it checks a validity window. A directory of fixture JSON would need a
//! parallel deserializer for every one of them — a second, unchecked model of
//! the system, which is precisely the thing that rots. Fixtures here are Rust
//! consts that call the real functions.
//!
//! # The method, chosen per surface
//!
//! The system is a mixture and pretending otherwise produces a harness that is
//! either flaky or fake. So:
//!
//! | surface | method | why |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`ranking`] | fixtures, exact expected answer | `rank` is a pure function of quotes, a lane and an FX table. A reference ordering is arithmetic anyone can redo by hand. Runs in CI forever. |
//! | [`expectation`] | fixtures, measured against the eventual truth | `Expectation::observe` is pure and takes its clock as a parameter. The comparison that matters — prediction error against *believing the claim* — is computable exactly. |
//! | [`suppression`] | fixtures, exact for the classification, systematic perturbation for the rate | [`verdict`](agentos_app::proof_of_need::verdict) is a pure function of two strings. What each case *should* classify as is definitional; what the field *rate* is cannot be got from fixtures at all, so it isn't claimed — see below. |
//! | [`toolchoice`] | deterministic snapshot in CI, small held-out set run by hand | The model is the one part that cannot be evaluated deterministically. |
//! | [`scoping`] | fixtures, swept over company size, weighed in tokens | What a turn assembles is a pure function of one employee's configuration, so a company of fifty can be built and one employee's turn billed exactly. The token count is an estimate — there is no tokenizer here and no network — and every assertion is a *comparison* under that one estimator, so its error cancels rather than reaching the pass/fail. |
//! | [`cost`] | one arithmetic function over samples a live run recorded, pinned by digest | What a month costs is arithmetic; what goes into it is a sample from a model. So the arithmetic is tested and the samples are recorded — and `docs/ORIZN.md` has to quote the sentence this crate produces rather than keep a copy of the number. |
//!
//! ## Why no judge, and no record-and-replay
//!
//! **No judge.** A judge is for grading open-ended output. "Which of three
//! tools should this turn have called" has a known right answer by construction
//! of the case — a judge would add a second model's noise and a bill to a
//! question we already hold the key to.
//!
//! **No record-and-replay of model responses.** Replaying a recorded response
//! measures our parsing, not the model, and the moment the prompt changes the
//! recording is answering a question that was never asked. Since the whole
//! point of the tool-choice suite is "does a prompt change make this worse", a
//! replay harness would be at its most confident exactly when it is most wrong.
//!
//! What replaces it is smaller and honest: CI pins a **digest of the rendered
//! system prompt**. Editing the prompt turns the suite red with "the recorded
//! live scores are stale", which is the true statement. Re-running the live set
//! is a human's decision, and it costs one local `claude` subscription and
//! about a minute.
//!
//! # Two labels, never mixed
//!
//! Every result carries a [`Truth`]. A fixture whose expected answer somebody
//! made up is worse than no fixture, because everyone then optimises against
//! one person's guess. So:
//!
//! * [`Truth::Correct`] — the expected answer is derivable from a definition,
//!   from arithmetic, or from the eventual observation. A failure is a bug.
//! * [`Truth::Characterises`] — the expected answer is *today's behaviour*,
//!   recorded so a change is visible. A failure is a question, not a bug.
//!
//! They print differently and they are counted separately. Nothing here
//! promotes the second into the first.
