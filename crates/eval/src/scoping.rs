//! Does scoping an employee to its own team actually save tokens?
//!
//! # The claim, and why it was worth checking
//!
//! The whole hierarchy — team-scoped documents, per-employee threads, one
//! charter each — is justified in `app::knowledge`'s module docs by an
//! arithmetic argument: *"every turn pays for the context it carries"*, so an
//! employee that can see the whole company pays for the whole company, every
//! turn, forever. Nobody had put a number on it. This suite does.
//!
//! # What it found
//!
//! **The line was flat above the tenth employee, and the flatness was not
//! scoping's doing.** The context moved once, between two employees and ten, for
//! the only N-shaped reason there was: the employee's own *team* filling its
//! five recall slots. Past that it did not move again, because
//! [`RECALL_LIMIT`] is a constant with no company in it.
//!
//! **It sloped for one revision, and the slope has been scoped away.** When the
//! prefix began naming the tenant's MCP inventory the context went 4188 → 4639 →
//! 4863 tokens at 2, 10 and 50 employees, and every token of that growth was the
//! inventory: per tenant, filtered by risk and by nothing else. It now reads
//! **4382 → 4805 → 4805**, because
//! [`agentos_app::prompt::SystemPrompt::with_mcp_tools`] takes the employee's
//! [`EffectivePolicy`] and names the tools `allowed_mcp_tools` lets it call —
//! flat across all three sizes, against 209 → 237 → 461 for the same inventory
//! named to everybody. The colleague roster contributes -5 → +49 → +49: it
//! saturates with the employee's own team and then stops, which is what it was
//! designed to do and what
//! `the_roster_costs_the_same_in_a_company_of_fifty_as_in_one_of_ten` gates on.
//!
//! **Two of those figures are not company-shaped and are folded in anyway.** The
//! MCP row is `McpOnly − Bare`, and only `McpOnly` carries a policy, so it also
//! carries the third list the prefix names: the domains `read_page` may point
//! at. That is 105 tokens of inventory plus 104 of "None." — the empty-allowlist
//! paragraph every employee of a fresh deployment gets, because
//! `store::policy::default_ceiling` grants no domain. An employee that *has*
//! domains pays 140 for the heading instead, plus five to nine per domain
//! named, and a long allowlist is linear in what an operator wrote rather than
//! in the payroll — which is why it has no row of its own here. Nothing in this
//! fixture varies it, and a row that cannot slope on this file's only axis
//! measures nothing.
//!
//! **No new mechanism came out of that.** The scope is not "the role" and not
//! "the team" as a thing this file invented: it is
//! [`PolicyLimits::allowed_mcp_tools`], intersected across platform ∧ tenant ∧
//! role ∧ employee, which the gate already enforces on every `McpCall` — and
//! whose `role` layer *is* the employee's team (`domain::org::Team::limits`,
//! capped at `Team::MAX_TOOLS_PER_EMPLOYEE`). Naming what is callable was
//! already the correct rule and was simply unwired. What is left sloping is the
//! deployment where an operator writes one tenant-wide allowlist and no team
//! layer: the row `…the same inventory with no policy scope` prices exactly
//! that, and there the slope is honest — those employees really may call all of
//! it, and a prefix that hid it would be hiding a capability rather than saving
//! a token.
//!
//! The tool catalogue is still five entries no matter how many MCP servers a
//! tenant binds, which is the collapsed `call_mcp_tool` doing its job — fewer
//! once the employee's role floor has narrowed it, which is a function of the
//! job and not of the payroll either.
//!
//! So the cost premise, taken literally, is **false**: scoping the corpus saves
//! nothing worth measuring whenever the employee's own scope holds five or more
//! matches, which is every corpus worth scoping. Retrieval is a fixed top-k, so
//! it is a fixed token budget whether it reaches one team or the whole tenant.
//! `app::knowledge`'s docs already concede this in prose ("the saving in bytes
//! is zero"); the row below is the number, and the number's **sign is
//! negative** — in this fixture the unscoped turn is the cheaper one, because
//! the other teams' passages are shorter. Which is the point: at a fixed top-k
//! the bill is set by whose prose fills the slots and not by whose slots they
//! are. What scoping buys is the *composition* of those five — a slot holding
//! the sales strategy is a slot not holding the answer — and that is a quality
//! argument, not a cost one.
//!
//! # The finding that mattered more than the flat line, and what came of it
//!
//! The previous revision of this file said the flat line was uninformative,
//! because it was flat for the wrong reason: the company was **absent** from the
//! prefix, not scoped out of it. No production path called
//! [`agentos_app::prompt::SystemPrompt::with_mcp_tools`], nothing named the
//! colleagues `message_colleague` takes as a free string, and the prediction
//! recorded here was that the first feature to put a company-shaped list in the
//! prefix would be the one that made the line slope.
//!
//! **Both are wired now**, and the prediction was half right, which is the
//! interesting half:
//!
//! * The **MCP inventory** is per *tenant*, so it sloped exactly as predicted
//!   and by roughly the predicted amount. What made it stop is not a second
//!   scoping mechanism but the rule the gate was already applying to the calls
//!   themselves: an employee is told about the tools its policy lets it call,
//!   asked through `policy::evaluate_mcp_call` rather than restated. The
//!   `Inventory::McpUnscoped` row below is the same measurement it always was,
//!   kept as the counterfactual — every employee paying for every server the
//!   company binds, on every turn.
//! * The **colleague roster** never did, and that was the design constraint it
//!   was built under. It is the employee's manager, its direct reports and its
//!   team-mates — `inbound::colleagues`, ruled on by `inbound::may_message` — so
//!   it is bounded by the team and not by the payroll. `Inventory::Unscoped`
//!   below is the counterfactual: the same roster with no join to
//!   `team_memberships`, which is what a company-wide list would have cost.
//!
//! The gap between each of those rows and its counterfactual is the whole
//! argument for scoping, stated in tokens, and it is the argument the *corpus*
//! row could never make — because retrieval is a fixed top-k and a fixed top-k
//! cannot slope, while a list of names is linear in what it lists. Scoping saves
//! nothing on documents and everything here. Both lists arrived at the same
//! bound the same way, too: by asking the rule that already decides whether the
//! thing may be reached, instead of writing a second rule about what may be
//! named.
//!
//! [`agentos_app::prompt::SystemPrompt::with_credential`] is still called by
//! nobody, and deliberately: no tool in `turn::catalogue` takes a credential,
//! `SecretStore` has no verb that enumerates one, and the only ref production
//! writes per employee is a provisioning canary. Its own doc comment carries the
//! three reasons.
//!
//! # Assertions are on shape, numbers are on the page
//!
//! Nothing here asserts "under 4,312 tokens". A reworded briefing would break
//! such a test and teach nobody anything. What is asserted is that neither list
//! in the prefix moves with company size while its unscoped twin does — for the
//! inventory as a *byte-identical prefix* across 2, 10 and 50 employees, which
//! is the strongest form the claim takes — that an untrusted turn is offered
//! strictly fewer tools, and that the corpus scoping saves less than one
//! passage. What is **characterised** rather than asserted is the total, which
//! still steps once between two employees and ten, and both counterfactuals.
//!
//! Every figure printed is an estimate with a stated error bound; every property
//! asserted is a comparison between two contexts weighed by the same estimator,
//! where that error cancels.
