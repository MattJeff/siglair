//! Does `proof_of_need` find real defects, and what does the two-run
//! byte-comparison throw away?
//!
//! # Why this suite exists at all, and the one change that let it
//!
//! The module docs ask an operator to read the suppression rate and to read it
//! *broken down by reason*, because "the bar is working" and "the panel
//! selector is wrong" produce the same headline number and opposite actions.
//! Until now that classification was reachable only through a Postgres
//! connection, a `PolicyGate` and a live `BrowserSession`, which is why nobody
//! had ever put a number on it. [`verdict`] is that decision lifted out of
//! `Prober::run` verbatim — same three branches, same order, no behaviour
//! change — as a pure function of two strings and a [`Claim`].
//!
//! **Nothing here weakens the bar and nothing here is allowed to.** The
//! suppression is deliberate. This measures its cost; it does not shop for a
//! way to avoid paying it.
//!
//! # Method, split in two because the ground truth is
//!
//! ## 1. Classification — fixtures, exact expected answers, [`Truth::Correct`]
//!
//! What each case *should* classify as is definitional, not a guess. A page
//! saying "no visa required" against an authority saying a visa is required
//! **is** a contradiction; a captcha **is** friction served to us and not a
//! statement about their checkout; "no e-visa needed" **is** something we
//! cannot turn into a requirement. Each fixture's expected value is written as
//! the `(outcome, detail)` pair that would land in `proof_of_need_attempts`, so
//! the fixture and the database column cannot drift.
//!
//! ## 2. The rate — systematic perturbation, [`Truth::Characterises`]
//!
//! **The field suppression rate cannot be obtained from fixtures and is not
//! claimed here.** A corpus of hand-written prospect pages produces a
//! hand-written rate; publishing that number would be the exact failure the
//! brief warns about, so the suite does not. The real one is a query and
//! [`REAL_RATE_SQL`] is printed in the report for whoever has the data.
//!
//! What *can* be measured honestly is the mechanism: take a panel that would
//! have produced a finding, apply one **named, benign** thing a real
//! e-commerce page does between two loads — a clock, a session id, a cart
//! counter, a rotating banner — and see what the bar does with it. The
//! population is not "prospects", it is "kinds of benign churn", and every
//! member of it is enumerated in [`Churn::ALL`]. That is a defensible sample
//! frame; "we imagined forty airlines" is not.
//!
//! # The result worth reading twice
//!
//! Benign churn suppresses *both* kinds of finding, and since `both_silent` it
//! does so **visibly for both**. A [`Finding::Contradicts`] page states a
//! requirement in both runs, so the pair lands as [`Divergence::SameAnswer`]. A
//! [`Finding::SaysNothing`] page has no requirement to compare, and the
//! identical churn lands as [`Divergence::BothSilent`]. Two reason codes, one
//! fix: a narrower [`Flow::panel`]. An operator adds them up.
//!
//! **It did not use to.** `BothSilent` did not exist, the says-nothing half fell
//! into [`Divergence::Undetermined`] pooled with pages we never got, and this
//! suite measured it at **0/8 diagnosable against 8/8** for the contradicts
//! half — half the loss invisible, on the very number the commercial argument
//! rests on. Both halves now read 8/8.
//!
//! What did **not** move: suppression is still 8/8 and 8/8. Every one of these
//! findings is still thrown away, and no churned pair produces [`Evidence`]. The
//! bar is untouched; only the label on the loss changed.
//!
//! The one thing `both_silent` refuses to claim is a page that came back
//! **empty**. That is not a checkout being silent about visas, it is a widget
//! that never rendered, and it stays [`Divergence::Undetermined`] — the
//! `one run silent, one run blank` fixture below is what holds that line.
