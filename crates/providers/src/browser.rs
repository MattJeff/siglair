//! Browser adapter: a persistent, isolated browser per employee.
//!
//! # Why a session is a provisioned resource and not a cheap handle
//!
//! Chrome keeps cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB and saved logins in the
//! profile directory named by `--user-data-dir`. That flag is a **process**
//! argument: one running Chrome, one profile. CDP's
//! `Target.createBrowserContext` does give a clean, isolated context inside an
//! already-running process, but it is incognito-shaped — it is destroyed with
//! the browser and writes nothing to the profile. So it buys **isolation
//! WITHOUT persistence**.
//!
//! An employee that must stay logged into a supplier portal between tasks needs
//! persistence *and* isolation from every other employee. With Chrome's actual
//! constraints that leaves exactly one self-hosted answer: **one browser
//! process per employee**, each started with its own `--user-data-dir`. A
//! session is therefore a unit of infrastructure with a memory footprint and a
//! lifetime, not a free object.
//!
//! The trait is shaped to say so:
//!
//! * There is no `new_session()`. The only way to get a context is
//!   [`BrowserProvider::ensure_context`], which takes an [`EnsureCtx`] and is
//!   subject to the crate's reconcile-before-create contract — the same
//!   treatment as buying a phone number, because it costs about as much.
//! * [`BrowserSession`] carries the `user_data_dir` that the process was
//!   started with. `None` means an ephemeral context: legitimate for a hosted
//!   provider that persists elsewhere (Browserbase contexts) or for a one-shot
//!   scrape, and a bug for anything that has to stay logged in.
//! * [`BrowserProvider::act`] takes a `&BrowserSession` rather than creating
//!   one, so no call site can quietly conjure a browser.
//!
//! # Why [`BrowserStep::Fill`] takes a `&Secret`
//!
//! A plan is data: it gets logged, persisted, replayed and — for an
//! LLM-authored plan — round-tripped through a model. A password inside a plan
//! that is a `String` is a password in all of those places. `Fill` therefore
//! holds a [`&Secret`](Secret), which has no `Display`, no `Serialize` and a
//! `Debug` that prints `[redacted]`. The plaintext leaves the vault only inside
//! the adapter, on the way into the DOM field, and the model that decided
//! "type the password here" never sees the password.
//!
//! # Why [`BrowserOutcome::Text`] is already [`Untrusted`]
//!
//! It is the only outcome that carries somebody else's *words*, and the caller
//! that wants them — `app::proof_of_need` — wants them precisely because it is
//! hunting for something quotable in them. Wrapping at the adapter, next to
//! `email::parse_inbound` and `telephony::inbound_sms`, means there is no
//! moment anywhere in the process when a page's text is a bare `String` that
//! somebody could concatenate. A screenshot is bytes and a navigation is a URL
//! we asked for; this one is a stranger talking.
