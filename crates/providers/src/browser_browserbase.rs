//! The real [`BrowserProvider`] against Browserbase's HTTP API.
//!
//! The shape is [`crate::browser`]'s — this module only supplies the wire
//! calls. Four things about Browserbase are load-bearing, none of them are
//! guessable from the trait, and two of them contradict the obvious design.
//!
//! # There is no SDK, and none is needed
//!
//! Browserbase publishes no official Rust SDK (the `browserbase` crate on
//! crates.io is one release by a stranger and must not be depended on). From
//! Rust the whole surface this adapter needs is plain REST — `POST
//! /v1/contexts`, `POST /v1/sessions` — plus the CDP websocket URL the session
//! hands back. `reqwest` is the entire dependency.
//!
//! # Persistence lives in the CONTEXT; the SESSION is disposable
//!
//! A **context** is the durable thing: cookies, localStorage and saved logins
//! for one employee, stored by Browserbase and re-hydrated into whatever
//! browser runs next. A **session** is a running browser: hard-capped at six
//! hours, and *destroyed when the last CDP client disconnects*. So any design
//! that keeps a long-lived per-employee session is wrong — it will be reaped
//! under you, and it will be reaped for certain at the six-hour cap.
//!
//! Hence: **one persistent context per employee, one short session per task.**
//! [`BrowserProvider::ensure_context`] provisions the context (and is the thing
//! subject to the crate's reconcile-before-create contract);
//! [`BrowserbaseBrowser::act`] opens a session, runs the step and lets the
//! session go. Nothing about a session is cached in this struct — there is
//! nowhere in it to put one, on purpose.
//!
//! [`BrowserSession::user_data_dir`] is therefore always `None` here — see
//! [`BrowserbaseBrowser::session_for`]. That is not the "ephemeral, will not
//! stay logged in" case the trait warns about: the state persists, it just
//! persists over there instead of in a local profile directory.
//!
//! # Why this adapter is worth having at all
//!
//! Self-hosted Chrome cannot give you cheap multiplexing *and* persistent
//! identity at the same time. Persistence is bound to `--user-data-dir`, which
//! is a **process** argument: one profile, one running Chrome, so N employees
//! that stay logged in cost N browser processes. The cheap alternative inside
//! one process, CDP's `Target.createBrowserContext`, is incognito-shaped: it
//! gives isolation **without** persistence and is discarded with the browser.
//! You may pick one. Browserbase Contexts exist precisely to remove that
//! trade-off — persistent identity that is not welded to a local process — and
//! that removal is the whole reason to pay for this adapter instead of running
//! Chrome yourself.
//!
//! # Never rebuild the connect URL
//!
//! `POST /v1/sessions` returns a `connectUrl`. Use it **verbatim**. It carries
//! session routing and credentials that are not reconstructable from the
//! session id, and a hand-assembled `wss://…?apiKey=…&sessionId=…` will break
//! the day Browserbase changes its edge. Because that URL embeds the API key,
//! [`LiveSession`] keeps it as a [`Secret`]: it is as leakable as the key
//! itself.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here: the CDP socket
//!
//! Driving the DOM means speaking CDP over a websocket, and none of that is in
//! *this file*. The seam is [`CdpDriver`]: the adapter owns the
//! Browserbase-shaped work (contexts, session lifecycle, secret hygiene) and
//! hands the verbatim connect URL to whoever owns the socket. Building
//! `Page.navigate` frames is Chrome knowledge, not Browserbase knowledge, and
//! belongs next to the socket that ships them.
//!
//! ponytail: one trait, one method — and the implementation is
//! [`crate::cdp::CdpWebsocket`], in this crate, over `tokio_tungstenite`.
//!
//! This note used to read "no in-tree implementation — a websocket dependency
//! is not on the table for this crate today. Delete [`CdpDriver`] and inline a
//! client the day one is." All three claims were overtaken the same afternoon
//! they were written, by the commit that added `cdp.rs`, and the instruction
//! is the wrong way round: the seam earned its keep rather than expiring.
//! `crate::mocks`' real adapter is handed a `CdpWebsocket` unconditionally, so
//! the trait's job now is the file split, not the missing client.
