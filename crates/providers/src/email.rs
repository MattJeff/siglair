//! Email: outbound sending, and the **two-phase** inbound path.
//!
//! # Inbound email is two-phase, and the trait says so
//!
//! Verified against Resend's own docs: the `email.received` webhook carries
//! **metadata only** — an email id, the envelope addresses, a timestamp. No
//! subject, no body, no headers, no attachment bytes. The attachment
//! `download_url` that shows up on the *fetched* message expires after **one
//! hour**.
//!
//! So the shape here is deliberately awkward in the same way reality is:
//!
//! 1. [`InboundNotice::parse`] turns a verified webhook body into a handle.
//!    That type has no body field, so no caller can accidentally build a
//!    [`CanonicalMessage`] out of a webhook.
//! 2. [`EmailProvider::fetch_inbound`] goes and gets the [`RawInbound`].
//! 3. [`EmailProvider::fetch_attachment`] goes and gets the bytes, *while the
//!    URL is still alive* — which is why [`RawAttachment::url_expires_at`] is
//!    a field and not a comment.
//!
//! Designing this as "the webhook hands you a body" would have every caller
//! above it written wrong, and the wrongness would only surface the first time
//! someone reads a 40 KB body or a 3 MB PDF out of a payload that never had
//! one.
//!
//! # Trust
//!
//! [`normalize`] wraps every byte the sender chose — `from`, `subject`, body,
//! and each attachment filename — in [`Untrusted`]. Nothing in `RawInbound` is
//! ours except the fields we minted, and the type system is where that fact
//! lives.
