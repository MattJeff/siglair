//! The outbound provider clients: email, telephony, browser, LLM, embeddings,
//! the lead sink and the secret stores.
//!
//! **Not the only crate allowed to hold a reqwest client**, which is what this
//! line said until somebody grepped it: `agentos-app` builds its own in
//! `oauth.rs` (the MCP token exchange) and in `peer_keys.rs` (an A2A peer's
//! JWKS), both because the SSRF check and the connect have to sit inside one
//! function — split across a crate boundary, the check is one refactor away
//! from being skipped. What *is* enforced, and by Cargo rather than by review:
//! this crate is absent from `apps/server`'s manifest, so the binary cannot
//! reach a provider except through `agentos-app`'s `Effects` façade.
//!
//! Every adapter ships with a mock beside it and a shared contract suite. The
//! contract every adapter must satisfy: `ensure` reconciles before it creates,
//! keyed on an idempotency key stamped into the provider's own tag field, so a
//! crashed-and-retried provisioning run never buys a second phone number.
//!
//! # The reconcile-before-create contract
//!
//! Every `ensure` implementation in this crate MUST, in this order:
//!
//! 1. **Look the resource up by tag.** The tag is [`EnsureCtx::tag`] — the
//!    string form of [`EnsureCtx::idempotency_key`] — stamped into whatever
//!    field the provider gives us for free-form labels: Twilio
//!    `friendly_name`, Resend domain name, Browserbase context name, a Stripe
//!    `metadata` entry. If the provider has a native idempotency header, send
//!    that too; it is a second belt, not a replacement for the lookup.
//! 2. **Return the hit.** If exactly one resource carries the tag, return it as
//!    [`Provisioned`] without creating anything. Two hits is a bug in a past
//!    version of the adapter, not something to paper over: return
//!    [`ProviderError::Terminal`] so a human looks at it.
//! 3. **Only then create**, stamping the tag into the same field the lookup
//!    reads. A create that cannot carry the tag is not idempotent and must not
//!    ship.
//!
//! The observable guarantee: calling `ensure` twice with the same
//! [`EnsureCtx`] yields ONE external resource with the SAME `external_id`.
//! [`IdempotencyKey::for_step`] is pure, so a process that crashes between the
//! provider's `201 Created` and our own commit rebuilds the identical key on
//! restart and finds the resource it already paid for. [`EnsureCtx::retry`]
//! bumps `attempt` and deliberately leaves the key alone — that is the whole
//! mechanism.
//!
//! [`FaultMode::FailAfterExternalSuccess`] exists to make chaos tests reproduce
//! exactly that crash window.
//!
//! # The release contract, which is the same discipline pointing the other way
//!
//! Every `release` implementation MUST be **idempotent and tolerant of an
//! already-gone resource**. Releasing twice, or releasing something the
//! provider no longer has, is `Ok(())`: the caller is asserting a desired state
//! ("this must not exist"), and if the state is already true there is nothing
//! to report. A 404 from a delete is success, not a failure.
//!
//! `ensure` reconciles before it creates because a *duplicate* is the expensive
//! mistake; `release` tolerates the missing resource because a *stranded
//! binding nobody may clear* is. The asymmetry in the write order follows:
//! `ensure` records its intent before it calls, `release` clears the binding
//! only after the provider has confirmed. A crash in either gap is repaired by
//! running the same operation again.
//!
//! A provider that genuinely **cannot** release something must say so —
//! `Terminal { code: `[`RELEASE_NOT_SUPPORTED`]` }` — and must not return
//! `Ok(())`. Pretending success clears the binding on a resource that still
//! exists, which is precisely how a thing gets billed forever with nothing left
//! pointing at it.
