//! Telephony: phone numbers, SMS, WhatsApp, and the inbound webhook.
//!
//! WhatsApp lives here rather than in its own module because it is the same
//! vendor, the same webhook endpoint and the same signature scheme; splitting
//! it would duplicate all three.
//!
//! Two pieces of real provider behaviour the spec got wrong, encoded here so
//! nothing above this layer has to guess:
//!
//! * **A regulated country has no pending number.** Buying a number in DE, ES,
//!   AU… requires an approved regulatory Bundle. Until it is approved the POST
//!   simply *fails*; Twilio does not hand back a number in a pending state. So
//!   [`TelephonyProvider::ensure_number`] returns
//!   [`ProviderError::PendingExternal`] carrying the bundle sid and **no
//!   [`Provisioned`] at all**. The caller must be able to say "ready later,
//!   nothing yet" — a `Provisioned` with an empty id would be a number that
//!   does not exist.
//! * **The 24-hour customer-service window.** Outside 24h from the customer's
//!   last inbound message, only an approved template may be sent. That is a
//!   type-level fact here: [`OutboundWhatsapp::FreeForm`] carries an
//!   [`OpenWindow`], and an `OpenWindow` can only be obtained from
//!   [`OpenWindow::since_last_inbound`] while the window is genuinely open. A
//!   free-text send outside the window is not a runtime error, it is
//!   unspellable. **And the window names the person it is with** — the proof is
//!   a window with somebody, never a window in the abstract — so
//!   [`OutboundWhatsapp::FreeForm`] has no recipient field of its own and
//!   free text addressed to anyone but that person is unspellable too.
