//! The real Twilio adapter: [`crate::telephony::TelephonyProvider`] over HTTP.
//!
//! There is no maintained Rust Twilio SDK, and there does not need to be: the
//! whole API is HTTP basic auth (`AccountSid:AuthToken`) with
//! `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` request bodies and JSON responses.
//!
//! Everything that is *policy* rather than transport already lives in
//! [`crate::telephony`] — the signature scheme, the webhook parser, the 24-hour
//! window type — and is reused verbatim here. This module is only the wire.
//!
//! Three pieces of real Twilio behaviour worth stating, because getting them
//! wrong costs money or hangs a workflow:
//!
//! * **Reconcile before create.** The idempotency key is stamped into
//!   `friendly_name`, and every purchase is preceded by a lookup on that field.
//!   The Messages API has no idempotency header at all, so a crashed retry that
//!   skipped the lookup would buy a second number and bill for it forever.
//! * **A regulated country has no pending number.** In DE, ES, AU… the POST to
//!   `IncomingPhoneNumbers` simply *fails* until a regulatory Bundle is
//!   approved. There is no half-created number to hand back, so this adapter
//!   returns [`ProviderError::PendingExternal`] carrying the bundle sid and
//!   nothing else.
//! * **Do not wait for a bundle callback.** The lifecycle is
//!   `draft -> pending-review -> in-review -> twilio-approved | twilio-rejected`
//!   and the status callback fires on every transition *except*
//!   `pending-review -> in-review`. A state machine that blocks on an
//!   `in-review` callback hangs forever. There is no such machine here: the
//!   caller re-runs `ensure_number`, which retries the purchase and either
//!   succeeds or reports the same `PendingExternal` again. Polling is the
//!   protocol.
