//! Approvals that authorise **one exact action**, not a category of them.
//!
//! The failure this module exists to prevent: a human reads "pay €100 to
//! supplier A", presses approve, and the agent then executes "pay €100 to
//! supplier B" under the same token — because the token said `payment_create`
//! and nothing narrower. Here the token is bound to a hash of the whole action,
//! and [`redeem`] re-hashes whatever is presented at execution time. A single
//! changed byte anywhere in the action produces a different hash and the
//! redemption is refused.
//!
//! # The canonical form
//!
//! The hash is `sha256` over the UTF-8 bytes of a canonical JSON serialisation
//! of the [`Action`], hex-encoded lowercase. Canonical means, precisely:
//!
//! * **Object keys sorted**, ascending by UTF-8 byte order, so serde's field
//!   order — or a future reordering of a struct's fields — cannot change the
//!   hash.
//! * **No insignificant whitespace**: no spaces after `:` or `,`, no newlines.
//! * **Arrays keep their order**, which is semantic.
//! * **Numbers are integers, written in the shortest decimal form**. Floats are
//!   *rejected*, not rounded: no `Action` carries one today ([`Money`] is
//!   `u64` minor units plus a currency code), and if one ever appears, an
//!   `Err` is the right answer rather than a hash that depends on a formatting
//!   library's mood.
//! * **Strings** use serde_json's escaping, which is minimal and deterministic:
//!   only `"`, `\` and control characters are escaped, and UTF-8 is emitted
//!   literally.
//!
//! ponytail: byte-order key sorting rather than RFC 8785's UTF-16 code-unit
//! order. The two agree for every key below U+10000, and every key here is an
//! ASCII identifier emitted by a `#[derive(Serialize)]`. If actions ever carry
//! caller-chosen object keys outside the BMP, switch the comparator — the
//! stored hashes would have to be re-derived, so do it in a migration.
//!
//! # Where the hash is computed
//!
//! In Postgres, by `sha256(convert_to($canonical, 'UTF8'))`. This crate has no
//! hashing dependency, and pulling one in for this is not worth a `Cargo.toml`
//! edit — but the better reason is that *one* implementation now computes the
//! hash on both the write and the redeem path, inside the same statement that
//! does the compare, so the two can never drift.
//!
//! `convert_to(text, 'UTF8')` and not `$1::bytea`: the text-to-bytea cast reads
//! `\x41` and `\101` escapes, and JSON strings contain backslashes, so that
//! cast would hash something other than the bytes we canonicalised.
//!
//! # Storage note
//!
//! `approvals` in `0001_core.sql` has no `action_hash`, `nonce`,
//! `requested_by` or `required_role` column, and a migration is owned by
//! someone else. Those four live inside the existing `action` jsonb as an
//! envelope:
//!
//! ```json
//! { "action": {…}, "action_hash": "…", "nonce": "…",
//!   "requested_by": "…", "required_role": "…" }
//! ```
//!
//! ponytail: envelope-in-jsonb instead of four real columns. `approvals` is
//! `0001_core.sql`'s; promote them in a migration of their own when someone
//! needs to index or report on them. The one
//! thing lost is the brief's `UNIQUE` on `nonce`; it is not load-bearing here,
//! because [`redeem`] matches on `id AND nonce` together — a nonce is only ever
//! usable against the approval it was minted for, so a (vanishingly unlikely)
//! collision between two approvals' nonces authorises nothing.
