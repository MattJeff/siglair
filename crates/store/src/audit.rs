//! The append-only audit trail.
//!
//! An audit row answers two questions, and the second one is the reason this
//! module exists. *What happened* is easy — every log does that. *Why was it
//! allowed* needs the `decision_id` of the Policy Gate ruling that authorised
//! the effect, written in the same transaction as the effect itself. Without
//! that link a trail tells you a payment went out and leaves you guessing which
//! policy let it.
//!
//! Three deliberate shapes:
//!
//! * **Write typed, read raw.** [`AuditEvent`] is a struct of domain types —
//!   [`ActionKind`], [`Decision`], [`EmployeeId`] — because a row you cannot
//!   delete is a row you cannot correct, so the mistake has to be caught at the
//!   call site. [`AuditRecord`] mirrors the row instead, strings and all: a
//!   reader that refuses to parse a kind written by a newer build would turn a
//!   forward-compatible append into a hard read failure.
//! * **Writes take the caller's [`TenantTx`].** Not a [`crate::db::Db`]. The
//!   audit row must commit or roll back with the thing it describes; a separate
//!   transaction would leave the trail claiming effects that never happened.
//!   `tenant_id` comes from the transaction, so it cannot be passed wrong.
//! * **There is no update and no delete.** Not "there is no function for it" —
//!   `app_role` lacks the privilege and a trigger rejects the statement even
//!   for a superuser (see `0001_core.sql`). The tests below prove both.
//!
//! # FOUNDER'S QUESTION, LEFT OPEN: how long may a row name a counterparty?
//!
//! The three shapes above are about correctness and they are settled. This one
//! is not, and it is the bill they run up: a row here names people who are not
//! customers of ours — `agentos_app::gate`'s `counterparty` writes a prospect's
//! address or number on every ruling it makes on an `EmailSend`, `SmsSend`,
//! `WhatsappSend`, `CallPlace` or `A2aSend`, and `app::inbound` writes an
//! inbound sender's under `from` — and **no statement in this system can ever
//! remove one**. Not a tenant deletion: the missing foreign key is deliberate,
//! so a tenant that leaves takes nothing with it. Not a correction: the trigger
//! binds superusers.
//!
//! This list used to carry a third entry — "`app::effects` writes both sides of
//! a refused WhatsApp send" — and it is corrected rather than dropped, because
//! the correction is the interesting part. That row is real code and it is
//! **not reachable in production**: `Effects::send_whatsapp` has no caller
//! outside `effects.rs`'s own test module, `ActionKind::WhatsappSend` is in
//! `turn::UNSERVED` so no model can propose one, and the procedure written out
//! in `turn::catalogue` for the day it is served derives the window from the
//! same `to` it then gates on — which is what would make the two numbers
//! disagree, so the caller that would write the row is the caller that makes it
//! impossible. `WHATSAPP_WINDOW_NOT_THEIRS`'s own doc says as much one crate
//! over; this file was citing it as a bill already run up.
//!
//! It stays named here because it is the *shape* the answer has to survive, not
//! because a deployment is carrying it: the day a WhatsApp arm is written, a
//! refusal writes a stranger's number into a table with no `DELETE`, and that
//! is a question to have answered before the arm, not after.
//!
//! That is the right answer for *what happened* and it has no answer at all for
//! *for how long*. A person who asks to be forgotten is answered today by a
//! `suppressions` row, which stops us writing to them and adds one more record
//! of who they are.
//!
//! The question is the founder's for `0063`'s reason — it is a judgement about
//! what this company owes somebody who never asked to be in a database, traded
//! against an audit trail whose whole value is that nobody can edit it, and no
//! number in this repository sources it. It is **not** a defect to fix in
//! passing, and it must not be answered by quietly leaving fields off refusal
//! rows: a trail that cannot say who a refused send was for is a trail that
//! cannot be audited, which is the cost of the other direction and it is real.
//!
//! Whatever the answer is, this module is where it lands: a retention job here
//! needs a privilege `app_role` must not hold and an exemption from the trigger
//! that `0001_core.sql` wrote to bind superusers, so answering it is a
//! migration and a decision, in that order. Until then every writer keeps
//! naming the counterparty, and this paragraph is why that is a choice rather
//! than an oversight.
