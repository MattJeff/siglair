//! `work_items`: the shared board, in SQL and with no opinion about it.
//!
//! `migrations/0061_work_items.sql` carries the argument for why the row has
//! four fields that matter and not fourteen. This module is the statements
//! underneath it: put one down, read the whole board, read one seat's open
//! items, read the ones nobody holds, take one, say one is done, and change the
//! half of a row an operator is allowed to change.
//!
//! # Two surfaces, and why the split is where it is
//!
//! [`post`] and [`amend`] are the founder's — he assigns anyone, ranks anything
//! and reopens what he likes. [`claim`] and [`close`] are an employee's, and
//! each carries its whole authority in its own `WHERE`: you may take what
//! nobody holds, and you may finish what is yours. Neither reads the org chart,
//! and neither has a lease — [`claim`] says why at length.
//!
//! # Why the tenant is never a parameter
//!
//! Every function here takes a [`TenantTx`] and nothing else, for
//! [`crate::halt`]'s reason: the tenant is the one `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id` on
//! that transaction, and a `tenant_id` argument beside it would be a second
//! answer to a question that already has one.
//!
//! # Why the order is spelled out here rather than left to the caller
//!
//! `ordinal asc nulls last, created_at asc` appears in both reads and nowhere
//! else. It is the founder's ranking, and a caller that sorted its own copy
//! would be a second ranking — the failure `0061`'s header calls two answers to
//! one question. The employee's brief and the founder's screen show the same
//! list in the same order because it is one `ORDER BY`.
