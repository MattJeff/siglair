//! The connection pool and the only two ways to reach it.
//!
//! [`Db`] owns a [`PgPool`] and does not expose it. There is no accessor, no
//! `pub(crate)` leak, no `Deref`. That is the entire security model of this
//! crate in one sentence: a query that forgets its tenant is not a bug you have
//! to catch in review, it is a program that does not compile, because the only
//! public way to obtain a connection is [`Db::tenant_tx`], which sets
//! `app.tenant_id` for the life of the transaction so the row-level security
//! policies in `0001_core.sql` apply.
//!
//! The escape hatch is [`Db::admin_tx_bypassing_rls`], named so that it cannot
//! appear in a diff without someone noticing. What legitimately needs it is a
//! *shape*, not a list: a loop that is cross-tenant by definition — outbox,
//! inbound, initiative, provisioning, the MCP binder, `/metrics` — a read of
//! the platform policy row, which belongs to no tenant, and the A2A ingress,
//! which has to resolve a tenant *from* the request it is authenticating, and —
//! the same shape, one layer earlier — the `api_keys` lookup, which is handed a
//! bearer token and whose whole job is to say whose it is. [`crate::api_keys`]
//! opens its transaction `READ ONLY` for that reason.
//! `grep -rn admin_tx_bypassing_rls` is the current list; a number here is not,
//! and the one that used to be here said "two callers: migrations, and the
//! outbox poller" while there were seventeen — and migrations was never one of
//! them, because [`Db::migrate`] runs the migrator against the pool and opens
//! no transaction at all.

///
/// ```sql
/// SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.columns
///  WHERE column_name = 'tenant_id' AND is_nullable = 'YES';
/// ```
///
/// `policy_versions` and `policy_layers`. The platform ceiling is
/// `tenant_id IS NULL`, which is one row for the whole database, and there is
/// nothing for a `WHERE tenant_id = $1` to hang off. A test that writes it
/// writes it for every test in every package running beside it, and `cargo
/// test --workspace` runs one process per package against one `DATABASE_URL`.
///
/// So a test whose subject *is* that row takes a database. See
/// [`crate::policy::tests`] for the three failures this was costing.
///
/// # A fresh handle every call, deliberately
///
/// Caching the [`Db`] in a `static` is the obvious optimisation and it does not
/// work: `#[tokio::test]` builds and drops a runtime per test, and a pooled
/// connection belongs to the reactor that opened it. The second test to use a
/// cached pool waits on connections whose runtime is gone and fails with
/// `PoolTimedOut`, nowhere near the cause. Connecting is one round trip and the
/// migrations are a no-op after the first test.
///
/// # Naming
///
/// `<the database in DATABASE_URL>_<suffix>`, which is what makes the cleanup in
/// `scripts/test.sh` work: it drops every database whose name starts with this
/// run's, so these go with it. A fixed prefix would not be collected — and for a
/// long time four harnesses in `apps/server` used one (`readyz_*`, `e2e_*`,
