//! The company-wide stop: one row, three verbs, and no opinion about what it
//! means.
//!
//! `migrations/0045_company_halt.sql` carries the argument for why a halt is a
//! lifecycle fact rather than a policy layer. This module is the SQL underneath
//! it and nothing else — it does not decide what a halt refuses, because the
//! two readers refuse different things and both of them live upstairs:
//!
//! * `agentos_app::gate::PolicyGate` reads it before any policy, so no
//!   [`Authorized`](../../agentos_app/gate/struct.Authorized.html) token is
//!   minted while a company is stopped, and therefore no effect reaches the
//!   world;
//! * `agentos_app::model_access::connected` reads it before a turn is reserved,
//!   so no new turn starts and no model token is billed to a customer who asked
//!   us to stop.
//!
//! # Why the tenant is never a parameter
//!
//! Every function here takes a [`TenantTx`] and nothing else. The tenant is the
//! one `SET LOCAL app.tenant_id` on that transaction, which is what row-level
//! security honours, and adding a `tenant_id: TenantId` argument would create a
//! second answer to a question that already has one — the exact shape of a
//! cross-tenant bug, in the one table where a cross-tenant bug means halting a
//! business that never called us. `crates/store/src/policy.rs::load` deleted a
//! parameter for the same reason.
//!
//! # The operating window is a halt, and it is here for that reason
//!
//! Step 8 of the entry journey asks how long the agents run. The answer is one
//! `company_windows` row (`migrations/0054_operating_window.sql`) and *no new
//! refusal*: [`halted`] reports an exhausted window as a [`Halt`], so all four
//! readers above and every one added since refuse a company whose time is up
//! without a line of code being added to any of them.
//!
//! The alternative — a window with its own reader list — is the same list this
//! module already has, kept twice. It desynchronised once already:
//! `initiative::claim_due` shipped without the halt check and had to be given
//! one afterwards. A window that travelled by its own road would have needed
//! the same repair on the same day, found by the same accident.

/// The two clauses a cross-tenant claim recites to skip a stopped company —
/// **written once, here, and pasted by the compiler.**
///
/// [`halted`] is the reader every per-tenant caller uses, and it knows both
/// stops. The claims cannot call it: they are cross-tenant SQL, driven by
/// `tenants` or by a queue table, with a clock the caller injects rather than
/// the `now()` that function reads. So they spell the predicate out — and a
/// predicate spelled out is a predicate that can be spelled out incompletely.
///
/// **That is not hypothetical, it is the local history.** The halt clause
/// landed in [`crate::outbox::claim_of`] while the window clause landed there
/// only, and for a while [`crate::initiative::claim_due`] still claimed the
/// employees of a company whose month had ended and spent their cadence on a
/// refusal. Two sites, one repair, one of them found by accident. A third
/// reciter — `apps/server`'s provisioning claim, which was buying mailboxes and
/// phone numbers for stopped companies — would have been a third chance to get
/// it wrong.
///
/// **And a fourth arrived the same week, from a branch that could not see this
/// one.** `apps/server`'s `loops::outbox::lag_secs` learned to ignore a stopped
/// tenant — a customer pressing stop was taking every replica out of the load
/// balancer — and spelled the two clauses out by hand, because on that branch
/// this macro did not exist yet. The merge kept both. That is four recitations
/// with a definition sitting between them, so it now calls this too, through
/// the second arm below.
///
/// So the sites now agree by construction. `concat!` runs at compile time, the
/// callers keep `&'static str` SQL and their measured query plans, and there is
/// exactly one place to edit when a fourth way to stop a company is invented.
///
/// # Contract
///
/// * `$tenant` is the SQL expression naming the tenant column in scope —
///   `"t.id"` where `tenants` drives the query, `"r.tenant_id"` where the queue
///   table does. It is a literal because `concat!` takes literals.
/// * **In the one-argument form, `$1` must be the caller's `now`, as
///   `timestamptz`.** Every claim in this workspace binds it first; a query
///   that renumbers its parameters has to renumber this too, and the compiler
///   will not say so. A caller whose `$1` is something else passes its clock
///   explicitly — see below.
/// * The fragment is a bare boolean with no outer parentheses, so it drops into
///   a `WHERE` directly and needs wrapping inside an `OR`.
///
/// # The second arm, for a query with no clock to bind
///
/// `not_stopped!($tenant, $now)` takes the clock expression instead of assuming
/// `$1`, and the two arms are **the same predicate over a different clock** —
/// not two predicates. That distinction is the whole reason the second arm
/// exists rather than a fourth hand-written copy: [`crate::outbox::claim_of`]
/// and [`crate::initiative::claim_due`] are given a `now` by the poller so it
/// can be moved in a test, while `apps/server`'s `loops::outbox::lag_secs` has
/// no `now` argument at all and reads the transaction's own `now()` — its `$1`
/// is `MAX_ATTEMPTS`.
///
/// So the arms must not be mixed inside one statement, and the rule is simply
/// that a caller passes the clock it already uses everywhere else in the same
/// query. `lag_secs` subtracts `now()` from `available_at` and compares
/// `available_at <= now()`; a window clause reading `$1` there would answer
/// about a different instant than the number it returns — and in fact does not
/// even typecheck, which is how this arm was found. `now()` is
/// `transaction_timestamp()`, so a statement that uses it twice cannot see the
/// window close halfway through itself, exactly as [`halted`] argues.
///
/// # It defers, it does not refuse
///
/// Every caller must *not select* the row rather than claim and reject it. The
/// callers' own docs carry the argument — burnt attempts, dead letters, a spent
/// cadence — and they all reduce to the same property: a row that was never
/// selected was never written, so lifting the stop makes it due again with no
/// intervention and no replay.
