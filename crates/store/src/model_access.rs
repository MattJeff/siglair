//! The tenant's model connection: one row, read on every turn, written once per
//! proof.
//!
//! `migrations/0041_tenant_model_access.sql` carries the argument for the table
//! and `agentos_domain::model_access` for the types. Two things about this
//! module rather than that one:
//!
//! **`load` returns `Option`, and `None` is the answer, not an error.** A tenant
//! with no row is not a failed read — it is a tenant nobody has connected a
//! model for yet, which is the state every tenant is in the moment 0041 lands.
//! Making it an error would put "the first-run step nobody did" and "the
//! database is broken" in the same branch, and the caller has to tell a person
//! which one it was in a five-minute setup flow.
//!
//! **A row this build cannot read is [`StoreError::Conflict`], never a skipped
//! row.** The `path` and `verified_model` columns hold closed enums whose
//! parsers return `None` for anything unknown. Text that does not parse means
//! the database and the binary disagree about what paths or models exist — a
//! rollback to an older build, or a `psql` session — and the safe reading of
//! that is *stop*, because the alternative is treating a connected tenant as
//! unconnected and refusing every one of their turns with a message that names
//! the wrong remedy.
//!
//! There is no `WHERE tenant_id` in either statement. `tenant_model_access` has
//! RLS forced and the policy is `with check` as well as `using`, so the tenant
//! filter is the database's rather than something a reader has to verify is
//! present in every query.
//!
//! **The credential travels with the row, sealed.** `0050_tenant_model_key`
//! argues why; what it means here is that [`load`] returns a [`Connection`] and
//! not a bare [`ModelAccess`], and that the pair is written by [`save`] in one
//! statement. Nothing in this module can open the blob — the cipher is
//! `agentos_app::mcp::Credentials`, one crate up — which is the property that
//! keeps a plaintext credential out of every SQL error, every `sqlx` log line
//! and every `Debug` this module could ever render.
