//! Teams: the layer between a tenant and an employee.
//!
//! One company runs several teams of AI employees at once — purchasing sourcing
//! suppliers, sales bringing in accounts, later regulatory-watch and support.
//! They share a tenant, a database and a runtime, and they must not collide:
//! different budgets, different tools, different policies. Until now there was
//! nothing between `tenants` and `employees`, so "the sales team may not spend"
//! had nowhere to live.
//!
//! Two things happen here and nothing else:
//!
//! **A team owns a policy layer.** Not a new one — the `role` layer that
//! [`crate::policy`] already intersects between the tenant's and the
//! employee's. [`set_policy_role`] records which `role_name` a team's limits
//! are written under, and `policy::load` resolves it in the *same statement*
//! that reads the layers, because a second round trip on the hot path of every
//! authorisation is a latency you regret later. Everything the four-layer
//! loader documents still holds and is not restated here: a team layer can only
//! tighten (the loader takes the minimum of each cap), and a team with no layer
//! written for it inherits the tenant's rather than `PolicyLimits::default()`,
//! which grants nothing.
//!
//! **A team owns a budget, and the budget is reserved rather than checked.**
//! This is the half that pays for the module. [`crate::spend`] already stops one
//! employee structuring a large payment into many small ones; it does nothing
//! about *ten* employees on one team each making a payment that is perfectly
//! legal on its own merit. A per-team cap that is read, compared and acted on
//! has exactly the bug 0003_spend exists to prevent, one scope up — and it is
//! easier to hit, because the ten requests come from ten different agents that
//! were never going to coordinate. So [`reserve`] locks the team's bucket row
//! for the day inside the caller's transaction, the same one that writes the
//! payment intent, and everything after that lock is serialised by Postgres.
//!
//! ```text
//! caller BEGIN
//!   org::reserve(..)  ── spend::reserve locks the EMPLOYEE bucket   (per-employee cap)
//!                     ── then locks the TEAM bucket for the day     (team budget)
//!   insert the payment intent
//! caller COMMIT
//! ```
//!
//! Both locks are taken in that order by every caller, so two employees on one
//! team queue on the team row rather than deadlock. An employee on no team pays
//! its own cap and nothing more. A team with no budget row may not spend at
//! all: absence fails closed, exactly as it does for `spend_caps`.
