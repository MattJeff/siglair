//! The transactional outbox. This is the message bus.
//!
//! There is no broker. An event is a row written by the same `COMMIT` that
//! wrote the state change it describes, and the transport is
//! `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — which is why [`enqueue`] takes a [`TenantTx`]
//! rather than a [`Db`](crate::db::Db). You cannot enqueue outside a
//! transaction, so "we updated the row but the notification never went out" is
//! not a failure mode that exists here.
//!
//! # The loop
//!
//! ```text
//! business tx:  UPDATE employees ... ; enqueue(...) ; COMMIT
//! poller tx:    claim(limit) ; COMMIT          <- short, just takes the work
//!    handler:   ...do the side effect...
//! poller tx:    mark_done | mark_failed ; COMMIT
//! ```
//!
//! [`claim`] deliberately commits before the handler runs. `SKIP LOCKED` only
//! excludes other pollers for as long as the claiming transaction is open, so
//! it alone would let a second poller grab the row the instant the first one
//! commits. What actually keeps the row to one worker is that the same `UPDATE`
//! that claims it also pushes `available_at` into the future — so a claim is a
//! lease with a deadline, and a poller that dies mid-handler loses the row back
//! to the pool automatically once the backoff expires. No liveness protocol, no
//! heartbeat, no reaper.
//!
//! # Two things the schema does not have, and how they work anyway
//!
//! `0001_core.sql` is owned by another unit and is checksummed by sqlx once
//! applied, so this module works with the columns that exist:
//!
//! * **Dedupe.** There is no `dedupe_key` column to put a
//!   `UNIQUE (aggregate_type, aggregate_id, event_type, dedupe_key)` on. But
//!   there is already a unique index on `id` — the primary key — so when a
//!   caller supplies a dedupe key the id *is* the dedupe tuple, hashed:
//!   `md5(tenant : aggregate_type : aggregate_id : event_type : dedupe_key)`.
//!   A retried business transaction computes the same id and collides with
//!   itself, and `ON CONFLICT` turns that into a no-op. Same guarantee, same
//!   index, zero DDL.
//!
//! * **Dead-lettering.** There is no `dead_lettered_at` column either, and it
//!   would be redundant: [`claim`] only ever selects rows with
//!   `attempt_count < MAX_ATTEMPTS`, so exhausting the attempts *is* the
//!   dead-letter state. Nothing has to move the row anywhere. [`dead_letters`]
//!   is the same predicate read back for whoever is on call.
//!
//! # Nothing deletes a row, and only one of the two piles costs anything
//!
//! There is no prune, no sweep, no `pg_cron`, and no `DELETE FROM
//! outbox_events` outside test fixtures. A row lives as long as its tenant does.
//! Two populations grow without a ceiling, and they are not the same problem:
//!
//! * **Published rows.** Both partial indexes are predicated on
//!   `published_at IS NULL`, so a published row leaves them the moment
//!   [`mark_done`] commits — the heap keeps it, no reader looks. Measured
//!   on PostgreSQL 17: **500 000 published rows, 94 MB, and neither [`claim_of`]
//!   nor `loops::outbox::lag_secs` moves at all** — 0.7 ms and 0.2 ms, the same
//!   as an empty table. This pile is disk and nothing else, and disk is the
//!   cheapest thing in this system. **It is not a defect and it is not urgent.**
//!
//! * **Parked rows** — [`park`], or eight failed attempts. `published_at` stays
//!   NULL, so they stay *in* the index, and nothing moves `available_at`, so
//!   they sort at the head of their tenant's range and every claim walked past
//!   every one of them. That one was real, it was the same shape `0046` exists
//!   to prevent — one customer's rows becoming every customer's latency — and
//!   `migrations/0057_outbox_claimable.sql` has the numbers and the fix.
//!
//! ## FOUNDER'S QUESTION, LEFT OPEN: how long may a published row be deleted?
//!
//! Not asked here because nothing needs the answer yet — the measurement above
//! is why this file has no retention constant to be wrong about. If disk ever
//! becomes the reason, the number is **not** an engineering choice, and the
//! constraint that decides it is [`enqueue`]'s:
//!
//! > the id of a deduped event is `md5(tenant : aggregate : type : dedupe_key)`,
//! > so the row *is* the dedupe record. Delete it and a re-delivery of the same
//! > event inserts a fresh row and the side effect happens a second time.
//!
//! So the retention floor is **how long a provider may re-deliver**, and every
//! provider that reaches this table has its own answer:
//! `routes::webhooks` keys on `<provider>:<delivery id>`, and
//! `apps/server/src/routes/halt.rs` is already holding an unanswered question
//! about Resend's retention for the same reason. One number, two decisions.
//! Until somebody has it, deleting a published row is trading a duplicate side
//! effect — a second email to a customer, a second model call on their key —
//! for disk. `audit_log` keeps the history either way; it is append-only, has no
//! foreign key to `tenants`, and is not what this table is for.
//!
//! Whoever eventually runs it is *not* a loop in `apps/server/src/loops/`. A
//! sweep by age reads no policy and takes nothing from anybody, so putting it
//! behind the emergency stop and the operating window would only raise the
//! question of whether a stopped company's disk keeps growing — a question
//! nobody has to answer if the sweep never asks. A migration cannot do it
//! either; it runs once. That leaves `pg_cron` or a cron'd `psql`, which is
//! where a `DELETE ... WHERE published_at < now() - <the number>` belongs the
//! day the number exists.
//!
//! Parked rows are a different question and the answer is already no: a dead
//! letter is an effect that was supposed to happen and did not, and
//! [`requeue_dead_letters`] is the way back. Deleting one destroys the only
//! record that anything is owed. It leaves the *index* now, not the table.
//!
//! # Clocks
//!
//! Every function takes `now`. Nothing here calls `now()` in SQL or
//! `Utc::now()` in Rust, so the backoff schedule is testable by advancing an
//! argument instead of sleeping through it.

/// every isolation test here proves a *table* hides.
///
/// So: **every tenant is offered a seat before any tenant is offered a second
/// one.** `tenants` drives the selection, one `LATERAL` per tenant takes that
/// tenant's oldest due rows, `row_number()` numbers the seats within a tenant,
/// and the outer order is seat-first. A tenant with nothing due contributes
/// nothing and costs one index probe. A tenant alone on the deployment still
/// fills the whole batch — round-robin is not equal shares of a queue nobody
/// else is using.
///
/// The lateral is capped, so the scan is `tenants × limit × POLLER_HEADROOM`
/// index entries at worst and not the whole backlog. `0046_outbox_fair_claim`
/// is the index it reads, and argues why it is a second one rather than a
/// widened `outbox_events_due_idx`.
///
/// # `shortlist`, and why the lock is not taken in the lateral
///
/// Two spellings were measured against 100 000 due rows across 52 tenants,
/// because both are correct and one of them is expensive in a way the plan does
/// not advertise:
///
/// * `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` **inside the lateral** needs no shortlist at all
///   and no headroom — the skip happens per tenant, so a second poller reads
///   deeper into the index by itself. It also takes a row lock on every
///   candidate: `tenants × limit` tuple writes to claim `limit` rows, which at
///   fifty busy tenants is a fiftyfold write amplification on the hottest
///   statement in the system.
/// * Locking **once, over a shortlist**, takes exactly `limit` locks. Without
///   the shortlist the planner joins 6 400 candidates to the table and picks a
///   hash join over a **sequential scan of the whole queue** — the one plan
///   this change must not produce. Cutting the candidates down to
///   `limit × POLLER_HEADROOM` first turns that into a nested loop on the
///   primary key.
///
/// The second, therefore. Measured: index scans throughout, 32 rows locked,
/// ~7 ms against that backlog, and no plan node that grows with the queue.
///
/// # The rest of the statement, unchanged and still load-bearing
///
/// * `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` — concurrent pollers step over each other's
///   in-flight rows instead of blocking on them. It sits on the `due` CTE
///   rather than on `seated` because PostgreSQL will not lock a select that
///   has a window function in it.
/// * **The due-ness predicate is repeated inside `due`, and deleting it as a
///   duplicate re-opens a double-charge.** `seated` reads `outbox_events`
///   *unlocked*, under the statement's snapshot; `due` is the only node that
///   takes a lock. When a row it reaches has meanwhile been claimed and
///   committed by another poller, `SKIP LOCKED` does not skip it — nothing
///   holds it any more — and PostgreSQL's `READ COMMITTED` recheck
///   (`EvalPlanQual`) walks to the new row version and re-runs *only the quals
///   present under the `LockRows` node*. With the join condition alone, `e.id =
///   c.id` still holds on the new version and the row is claimed a second time,
///   inside a lease that has just been pushed 120 seconds out. Measured, not
///   argued: two sessions, ten due rows, the second session's snapshot taken
///   before the first committed — every one of the first session's five rows
///   came back to the second as well, with `attempt_count = 2`. In
///   `apps/server`'s two-poller test that is 24 of 60 events handled twice, 2.2
///   ms apart, and one of the rows in this table is `agent.turn.requested`: a
///   model call the customer is billed for. Repeating the three columns here
///   makes the recheck evaluate them against the version actually locked, and
///   the second poller reads past to the next rows instead. The `seated` copy
///   still earns its place — it is what the index scan in the lateral uses, and
///   removing it would shortlist the whole table.
/// * `AS MATERIALIZED` on **every** CTE, and it is not a hint. Written the
///   obvious way — `WHERE id IN (SELECT … FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED LIMIT $n)` —
///   the subplan can be re-executed per outer row, and each re-execution steps
///   over whichever rows a *concurrent* poller holds locked right then, so the
///   UPDATE touches the union rather than `$n` rows. The rows stay disjoint
///   between pollers, so nothing is handled twice; what breaks is the bound.
///   A poller that claims 16 with a limit of 10 has silently stopped bounding
///   its own batch, which is the only thing standing between one tick and the
///   whole table. A single-session test returns exactly `$n` and proves
///   nothing: the initiative loop's two-poller test caught the same query shape
///   claiming 13, then 16, against a limit of 10.
/// * `attempt_count + 1` — counted at claim time, so a worker that is *killed*
///   mid-handler still burns an attempt.
/// * `available_at` pushed out by [`LEASE_SECS`] plus an exponential backoff
///   with jitter — the lease, which expires by itself. The floor is what makes

    // the `now()` that function uses. The two must agree, and the cost of
    // them disagreeing is stated exactly by the paragraph above — a company
    // whose month ran out would have every queued piece of its work claimed,
    // refused by the gate, and dead-lettered inside five minutes. A window
    // ending is not a reason to destroy the mail.
    //
    // FOUNDER'S QUESTION, LEFT OPEN: these rows then wait forever, because
    // a window that ended has no release verb the way a halt does. Deferred
    // is the conservative half — nothing is lost and extending the window
    // drains them all — but "what happens to a finished company's queue"
    // is a product decision (drain once? export? expire?) and this file
    // will not invent one.

    // time from `crate::halt` — same tokens, same plan, one definition. The
    // paragraph above explains why this query cannot simply call
    // `halt::halted`; the macro is what stops the workaround being copied a
    // fourth time by hand.
    //
    // **`e.attempt_count < $2::int` in the lateral stopped being a filter and
    // became an index predicate**, and that is the whole of
    // `migrations/0057_outbox_claimable.sql`: dead letters are not in
    // `outbox_events_claimable_idx` at all, so the claim no longer walks past
    // every one a tenant ever produced. The clause reads the same; what
    // changed is underneath it.
    //
    // A partial index is only usable when the planner can *prove* the query
    // implies its predicate, and about a parameter it can prove that only from
    // the parameter's value — that is, from a **custom** plan. Measured on

/// receives mail *before* connecting a model. `apps/server/src/main.rs` turns
/// `NoModel` into a `String` and hands it to the retry channel, so eight
/// attempts — about two minutes, per [`claim`]'s schedule — pass before anybody
/// has finished pasting an API key. Every one of those messages is then a mail
/// the customer's employees will never answer, on a system whose entire premise
/// is that they do.
///
/// # It is untargeted except for one exclusion
///
/// This requeues *every* exhausted event the tenant has, not the ones that died
/// of `NoModel`. The alternative — deciding, per row, whether the operator's fix
/// addresses the reason it died — means pattern-matching a human sentence that
/// any refactor is free to reword, and a filter of that shape that silently
/// stops matching is worse than no filter: the symptom is the same permanent
/// silence this function exists to end.
///
/// The one exception is [`UNREMEDIABLE`], and it inverts that argument rather
/// than ignoring it. It is an **exclusion**, not an inclusion, so its failure
/// mode is the safe one: a marker that stopped matching would revive the row and
/// let it repark, which is exactly the behaviour of the day before this existed,
/// not a new permanent silence. And it is a constant this module owns, shared
/// with the one writer, rather than a sentence read back by guesswork.
///
/// # Why an exclusion is needed at all
///
/// Because the "returns to exactly where it was" bound this function used to
/// claim is not true of every terminal failure. It is true of a poisoned
/// payload, which fails again in microseconds. It is **false** of a turn that
/// exhausted `app::turn::Budgets` — those are a hardcoded `Default` that no
/// operator lever raises, so reviving one buys `max_turns` fresh model calls, on
/// the customer's own key, to arrive at the identical number and park again. And
/// the trigger is not the rare deliberate act the paragraph above assumed:
/// `policy::activate` runs on every `install_layer` and every `rollback_layer`,
/// which is once per step of onboarding. Nothing converged and every pass was
/// billed.
///
/// So a writer that knows no operator verb can change its answer says so, and
/// this leaves the row where it is: still unpublished, still in
/// [`dead_letters`], still carrying the reason — visible and free, instead of
/// invisible and expensive. What it costs is that a turn which genuinely needs a

/// to unstick it, and the row naming its ceiling is what tells an operator one
/// has to be built.
///
/// # What it does not touch
///
/// `published_at`, because an event that was published is done and replaying it

// and the expensive case is expensive because it updates 100 000 of 100 100 rows,
// which no index makes cheaper.
//
// **The ceiling is not slowness, it is `REQUEST_TIMEOUT`.** Both callers run
// inside an HTTP request that `apps/server/src/main.rs` gives 30 seconds, and the
// table above crosses it somewhere around three quarters of a million. What
// happens then is not a slow success: the layer answers 408, the handler future
// is dropped, the transaction rolls back — and the transaction is the one holding
// the *credential*. `POST /v1/model` would fail to connect a model because of the
// mail that is waiting for the model, every retry would redo the same work and
// fail the same way, and the verb that exists to unstick a tenant would be the
// thing keeping it stuck. That is a real cliff and it is worth knowing it is at
// ~750 000 rather than "eventually".
//
// FOUNDER'S QUESTION, LEFT OPEN, AND DELIBERATELY NOT ANSWERED HERE: bounding
// this to the oldest `n` is the way out, and `n` is not an engineering choice.
// Today the contract is "everything comes back"; bounded, it becomes "some of it
// came back and you have to run the verb again", and neither caller can say so —
// `connect` and `activate` both *log* the count and hand back an answer about a
// credential or a policy version, so a partial revival would be invisible to the
// person who has to repeat it. So the number and its telling are one decision:
// how many, and where does the operator read "500 of 100 000"? Nothing is near
// the cliff (the largest pile this deployment could hold is one parked row per
// unanswerable message), so this ships unbounded and measured rather than bounded
// and guessed.
