//! Persistence for the shared number pool: `0010_phone_pool.sql` in Rust.
//!
//! The schema comment is the design document — read it first. What this module
//! adds is the two operations that have to be atomic: claiming a seat and
//! giving it back.
//!
//! # Why `allocate_atomic` is two statements, and used to be one
//!
//! A pool with one free slot and two employees provisioning at the same
//! instant is the normal case during onboarding, not a corner case. The claim
//! takes a `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED` row lock on `phone_numbers`, exactly like
//! [`outbox::claim`](crate::outbox::claim) and the release sweep: the loser
//! skips the row its rival holds, finds no other number with room, and is told
//! the pool is full. It does not block, and it does not take the slot.
//!
//! The occupancy count lives in no column. It is
//! `count(live allocations) < capacity`, so there is nothing to drift out of
//! sync with the allocations themselves. A cached counter here would be a
//! second copy of a fact that can only ever disagree with the first.
//!
//! **That count is not answered under the row lock, and for one statement it
//! read as though it were.** It is a `SubPlan` in the scan's `Filter`, which
//! runs *below* `LockRows` and over a table the lock does not cover, so it is
//! answered once from the statement's snapshot and never re-asked — the
//! `READ COMMITTED` recheck only refetches the locked row itself, and nothing
//! ever updates a `phone_numbers` row. So the claim that used to be one
//! statement over-allocated: a claimer whose snapshot predated a rival's commit
//! and whose lock landed after it saw an empty number and took a seat on it,
//! and a `capacity = 1` number — the schema's dedicated-number strategy — ended
//! up carrying two employees. Splitting the claim in two puts the count in a
//! statement of its own, which is a snapshot of its own, taken with the lock
//! already held. See [`allocate_atomic`] and
//! `tests::a_seat_taken_mid_statement_is_not_taken_twice`.
//!
//! One consequence to keep: **the lock is the whole of the mutual exclusion, so
//! it only binds writers that take it.** Anything that inserts into
//! `number_allocations` without going through [`allocate_atomic`] can still
//! push a number past its capacity, and no constraint in `0010_phone_pool.sql`
//! will stop it — a bound of the form `count(*) <= capacity` is not something a
//! `CHECK`, a unique index or an exclusion constraint can express, because the
//! capacity is a column of the other table.
//!
//! # Inbound routing is not here, and `counterparty_affinity` is dead
//!
//! This module used to own the routing too — `resolve_inbound` (affinity
//! first, longest-standing live allocation second) and `touch_affinity`
//! (upsert into `counterparty_affinity`, return the incumbent). Nothing outside
//! `#[cfg(test)]` ever called either of them. The rule that ships is
//! `agentos_app::inbound::resolve_phone_recipient`, one `ORDER BY` over
//! `employee_resources` joined to `conversations`, and it reads the affinity
//! off the `conversations` row the landing transaction has already written —
//! which is why the second table never got a writer.
//!
//! **`counterparty_affinity` (`0010_phone_pool.sql`) is therefore a table
//! nothing writes and nothing reads.** An applied migration is immutable, so
//! it is still there; do not build on it. The affinity is
//! `conversations.(employee_id, channel, external_ref)`.

    /// — so two live allocations on it is not a row too many in a table. It is
    /// `app::inbound::resolve_phone_recipient` finding two employees allocated
    /// to one address and handing every cold inbound message on it to whichever
    /// one was allocated first, which is one employee reading another
    /// employee's supplier. Both are the same tenant's, so this is never a
    /// cross-tenant leak; it is a colleague's.
    ///
    /// **Not a live incident today, and the honest reason is the config, not
    /// the code.** `EngineConfig::default()` — what `apps/server::main` builds —
    /// is `provision_phone: false` and `NumberStrategy::Dedicated`, and
    /// `not_wired` short-circuits before `take_pooled_slot`, so nothing in the
    /// shipped server calls [`allocate_atomic`] at all. What changed is the
    /// other end: `0069_a_number_is_an_endpoint_too` wired the inbound half, so
    /// the day the pooled strategy is switched on this stops being a row and
    /// becomes a delivery. That day should not also be the day this is found.
    ///
    /// # Why the interleaving is arranged rather than raced for
    ///
    /// Both claimers pay the same statement, so the ordering comes from
    /// starting them [`DELTA`] apart: the first takes its snapshot at `0`,
    /// reaches its lock at `S`, commits at `S + ε`; the second's snapshot is at
    /// `Δ` and its lock at `S + Δ`. Every `Δ` between `ε` and `S` is the
    /// defect's window. `S` is 14–15 ms against this fixture and `ε` is a
    /// commit, so `Δ = 8 ms` sits in the middle of it.

    /// of it: the ordering where the second claimer's snapshot is taken after
    /// the first has committed asserts nothing at all — it simply sees a full
