//! Reading the policy an employee runs under out of Postgres.
//!
//! The gate used to be handed a `PolicyBook` at construction: limits lived in a
//! Rust struct, so changing what an AI employee was allowed to spend meant a
//! redeploy, and an operator could not see the current answer at all. The rows
//! in `0006_policy.sql` are that struct, persisted; this module turns them back
//! into a [`EffectivePolicy`].
//!
//! Four layers, most restrictive wins:
//!
//! ```text
//! platform  (tenant_id IS NULL — the ceiling, writable only by an admin tx)
//!   ∧ tenant
//!     ∧ role
//!       ∧ employee
//! ```
//!
//! Two properties carry the whole design:
//!
//! * **A lower layer can only tighten.** The combination is
//!   [`EffectivePolicy::try_new`], which takes the minimum of every cap and the
//!   intersection of every allowlist. A tenant row saying `999_999` where the
//!   platform says `50_000` does not produce `999_999`; it produces `50_000`.
//!   There is no read path that skips that call — [`load`] is the only public
//!   reader, and it returns the intersected value, never the raw layers.
//! * **An absent layer inherits the layer above.** Not `PolicyLimits::default()`,
//!   which grants *nothing* and would make "the tenant did not write a role
//!   layer" mean "this employee may not send email". The layer above is
//!   substituted, and intersecting a layer with itself is a no-op.
//!
//! A stored policy that is not coherent fails here, loudly, with the layer named
//! — before it reaches the gate. `approval_above` above `max_per_transaction`
//! is a policy where the approval step can never fire, and the safe reading of
//! it is not "approve nothing", it is "this configuration is wrong, refuse to
//! run on it".
//!
//! # Getting a ceiling into an empty database
//!
//! [`install_ceiling`] writes one, [`default_ceiling`] is the one worth
//! shipping, and [`rollback_ceiling`] undoes it. They are driven by
//! `agentos-server policy install`, which is the whole operator story: without a
//! platform layer [`load`] answers [`PolicyLoadError::NoPlatformLayer`] and the
//! deployment denies every action, and until that command existed the only way
//! to fix it was hand-written SQL.

// The ceiling
// ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

/// The default platform ceiling: the widest anything in a fresh deployment may
/// be, **not** a recommendation of what any employee should be allowed.
///
/// Every number here is an upper bound that four layers then narrow. It exists
/// because the alternative is an operator inventing a turn budget and a spend
/// cap out of nothing on day one, and the failure mode of a guessed ceiling is
/// silent — a number too big does not break anything until it does.
///
/// It is also, on a fresh install, the *effective* policy of every tenant:
/// [`load`] inherits a missing layer from the layer above, so until a tenant
/// writes limits of its own the ceiling is the whole answer. So these are
/// chosen to be defensible as a policy, not merely as a bound.
///
/// * **USD, $500 per transaction.** One payment an employee may make with no
///   human in the loop is bounded by the size of a routine supplier invoice or
///   a software renewal — useful, and recoverable when it is wrong.
/// * **$100 approval threshold.** [`agentos_domain::policy::evaluate`] compares
///   `amount >= approval_above`, so this is the "nobody looks" line: below it an
///   employee spends alone, at or above it a human presses the button. $100 is
///   the amount a business writes off without an investigation.
/// * **$2 000 per day.** The structuring guard, four transactions wide: the
///   worst day is a number a company can absorb and an auditor can see.
/// * **Email, internal and web only.** Email is the channel the product exists
///   for; internal never leaves the process; web is the operator console. SMS,
///   WhatsApp and voice reach a phone — the most regulated surface and the one
///   with no undo — and A2A hands an employee a conversation with somebody
///   else's agent. Those are per-deployment decisions, not defaults. (Two of
///   them have no adapter in this build at all: a ceiling that permits what
///   cannot happen is a ceiling that lies.)
/// * **No calling codes**, which follows: an allowlist of countries with no
///   phone channel above it grants nothing, and pretending otherwise invites
///   somebody to "fix" the country list and wonder why calls still refuse.
/// * **No domains, no MCP tools, no A2A peers — empty, and empty means
///   denied.** There is no wildcard [`Domain`] to write here even if we wanted
///   one ([`Domain::parse`] demands two labels and matching is a label suffix),
///   and there is no universal tool or peer: those names are specific to a
///   deployment. Empty is the only honest ceiling, and it fails closed for the
///   surface where a model is reading attacker-controlled text.
/// * **50 new contacts per employee per day.** The cold-outreach budget: a
///   working day of deliberate first contacts, far under the volume that gets a
///   sending domain blocklisted, and low enough that an employee stuck in a
///   loop stops before a spam filter notices it.
/// * **200 turns per day.** The only limit on an employee that never spends
///   anything: roughly one wake every seven minutes around the clock, which is
///   above any human-paced workload and bounds what a wedged initiative loop
///   can cost overnight. Zero — [`PolicyLimits::default`] — would mean no
///   employee may ever act on its own.
/// * **Uploads, credential changes and data deletion off.** An upload is the
///   exfiltration primitive and needs a domain allowlist that is empty anyway;
///   a credential change rotates a secret the deployment depends on; and
///   deleting one conversation is the one flag that makes erasing customer data
///   an *unattended* action. None of the three has a good reason to be on
///   before somebody asks for it.
/// * **Lead upload off**, which is the fourth of those and the one with a
///   stranger on the other end. With it off, `agentos_app::queue` hands its
///   ten columns to `queue::csv` and a human uploads them; with it on, the same
///   queue goes straight to the sending platform, one gated call per prospect.
///   The refusals are identical either way — that is the whole point of the
///   seam — but a file has a person in the loop and an API call does not, and
///   which of those a deployment gets must be somebody's decision rather than a
///   default.

///    cap and the intersection of every allowlist — so a tenant, role or
///    employee layer naming a smaller number still wins, whatever is written
///    here. [`load`] is the only reader and there is no path around that call.
///    Widening one tenant means writing *that tenant's* layer, which this
///    function cannot address.
/// 2. **A tenant cannot invoke it.** It takes a [`Db`] and opens an admin
///    transaction, so its authorisation is possession of the database
///    credential. No API key, no tenant, no HTTP.
///
/// The honest exception, stated because it is the thing that surprises people:
/// a tenant that has written **no** layer of its own inherits the ceiling
/// ([`load`] substitutes the layer above rather than `PolicyLimits::default`,
/// which would grant nothing). So on a fresh install a wider ceiling *is* a
/// wider effective policy — not because this overrode a tenant's limit, but
/// because that tenant never expressed one. That is why [`default_ceiling`]
/// is chosen to be safe as a policy and not merely as a bound.
///
/// # Idempotent, and versioned rather than edited
///
/// The active ceiling is read back and compared as a [`PolicyLimits`]; an
/// identical one is [`Installed::Unchanged`] and writes nothing. Anything else

/// Nothing is edited in place — the same reason `0006_policy.sql` revokes

///

/// that would throw the ceiling and its whole history away — so this **refuses**
/// instead, naming the versions it would have destroyed. It cannot be
/// `#[cfg(test)]`: the test suites of three other crates call it, and that

///
/// There is exactly one active platform version per database
/// (`policy_versions_one_active_idx`), so callers cannot each have their own.
/// The row is therefore *unioned* with every `limits` installed through here:
/// the maximum of each cap, the concatenation of each allowlist, the OR of each
/// flag. That is safe in the only direction that matters — a wider ceiling
/// grants nothing on its own, because every caller also writes its own layer
/// and [`EffectivePolicy::try_new`] takes the minimum. It is also why
/// `denied_domains` is deliberately **not** unioned into the ceiling: denials
/// union rather than intersect, so one caller's block would become every
/// tenant's.

/// Concurrency-safe without a lock: the ceiling row is one row, and concurrent
