//! Claiming a provisioning step, and the write-ahead log that makes a crashed
//! provider call discoverable.
//!
//! This module is the reason a crash cannot buy two phone numbers.
//!
//! **Not advisory locks.** The spec called for `pg_advisory_lock` on the
//! employee. That is wrong here and the code deliberately does not do it:
//! advisory locks are *session*-scoped, this is a pooled sqlx application, so
//! the acquire and the release can land on different pooled connections; a
//! worker that panics never releases; and one lock per employee serialises
//! eleven steps that have nothing to do with each other. Instead:
//!
//! * [`claim_step`] takes a real **row** lock (`SELECT ... FOR UPDATE`) for the
//!   read-modify-write, and lets it go at commit — no lock outlives its
//!   transaction, ever.
//! * The claim it hands out is backed by **explicit lease columns**
//!   (`lease_owner`, `lease_until`) that expire on their own, so a worker that
//!   dies mid-step frees its work by doing nothing at all.
//!
//! The sequence a worker runs is:
//!
//! ```text
//! tx1: claim_step -> begin_intent -> COMMIT     (durable "a call may happen")
//!      call the provider                        (the crash window)
//! tx2: finish_step -> COMMIT                    (resource + intent + outbox)
//! ```
//!
//! The intent row is written **before** the network call and committed, which
//! is the whole point: a process that dies in the crash window leaves an
//! `in_flight` row behind, and [`sweep_expired_leases`] finds it. Without that
//! row a bought-and-forgotten phone number is invisible.
//!
//! [`finish_step`] writes the resource state, the intent outcome and the outbox
//! event in one transaction, all guarded by `WHERE lease_owner = $me`, so a
//! worker whose lease expired and was stolen while it was talking to the
//! provider cannot land a stale result on top of the new owner's work.
//!
//! # The same window, for a call that is not a step
//!
//! A send holds no lease and converges no resource, but it has the same gap
//! between the request leaving and the answer arriving. [`begin_send_intent`],
//! [`settle_send_intent`] and [`unsettled_calls`] are that gap's before, after,
//! and — the one that makes the other two worth writing — the reader for the
//! requests that never got an after. They promise less than the step machinery
//! above does, and say so in their own docs.
//!
//! Nothing here reads the clock; every entry point takes `now`.

// leaving and the answer arriving, and a process that dies inside it has done
// something to somebody that no row in this database mentions.
//
// The three functions below are that window's before, after, and — the one that

// an after.

/// Record, durably, that we are about to ask `provider` to do one thing under
/// `key`.
///
/// The sibling of [`begin_intent`], and it exists because that one cannot be
/// reused: it takes a [`Claim`] — a leased `employee_resources` row plus a
/// [`Step`] — and hard-codes `intent_kind = 'provisioning_step'`. A send has no
/// lease, no step and no row. It leaves `step` NULL, which is what
/// [`unsettled_calls`] reads to tell the two kinds apart.
///
/// Call it and **commit before the request leaves**. That commit is the whole
/// mechanism; everything else here is bookkeeping around it.
///
/// # There is no `ON CONFLICT` clause, and that is the guard rather than the
/// missing half of one
///
/// [`begin_intent`] has one because a provisioning key is *deliberately* stable
/// across attempts — same employee, same step, same key forever — so a retry has
/// to be able to find its own row. A send key is the opposite: it is derived
/// from one Policy Gate ruling, and a ruling is minted fresh per token and
/// consumed by value, so no two requests can ever present the same key. If one
/// somehow did, the right answer is that the request **must not leave**, and

/// with no branch here to get wrong. The caller sees a store error and sends
/// nothing.

///
/// It does **not** make a duplicate impossible, and it does not try to. Nothing
/// here reaches the provider. The send APIs it is written for take no

/// `in_flight` can never be resolved by asking, and the retry that follows a
/// crashed send arrives under a *new* ruling and a new key — this function will
/// happily write it a second row. What it buys, and the whole of what it buys,
/// is that an ambiguous send is **recorded** as ambiguous instead of being
