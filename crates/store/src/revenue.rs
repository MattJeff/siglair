//! Persistence for the seller vertical: prospect accounts, the humans at them,
//! the findings we can prove about their product, the deals that follow, and
//! the suppression list that outranks all of it.
//!
//! The schema is in `migrations/0011_revenue.sql` and carries the rules; this
//! module is the thin, typed way to reach it. It is deliberately the same
//! module `sourcing.rs` is, one vertical over — same [`TenantTx`], same money
//! discipline, same "the constraint is the enforcement" habit. Four things are
//! worth knowing before reading further.
//!
//! **No query in this file filters on `tenant_id`.** Not one. Every function
//! takes a [`TenantTx`], which has already set `app.tenant_id`, so the
//! row-level security policies do the filtering. A `WHERE tenant_id = $n` here
//! would be a second, weaker copy of a rule the database already enforces.
//!
//! **Suppression is not checked here, and that is the point.** There is no
//! `is_suppressed()` for a caller to forget. Writing an active [`NewContact`]
//! whose address is on the list, or recording an outbound
//! [`Event`] against one, fails in Postgres with
//! [`RevenueError::Suppressed`] — including when the person opted out globally
//! through a different tenant, which this tenant cannot see and does not need
//! to. [`suppress`] deactivates the matching contacts as it writes.
//!
//! The daily volume cap is **not** implemented here. That is
//! `max_new_contacts_per_day` in the policy tables, and a second mechanism for
//! the same rule is how two mechanisms disagree; [`new_contacts_since`] is the
//! count that field is compared against.
//!
//! **Evidence is written once and never again.** [`insert_evidence`] is the
//! only way in and there is no way out: `app_role` holds no UPDATE or DELETE on
//! the table and a trigger refuses both regardless of privilege. A finding is a
//! factual claim about someone else's product; one that can be edited after it
//! was sent is not a finding. Every column that makes it reproducible is NOT
//! NULL, so an unreproducible finding cannot be stored, let alone sent.
//! `observed_claim` is the prospect's own text, and being in our database does
//! not make it ours — it stays `Untrusted<T>` on the way to a model or a human.
//!
//! **Every check is recorded, not only the ones that found something.**
//! [`record_attempt`] files one row per proof-of-need check whatever it came to
//! — evidence, agreement, unreadable, not-reproducible, blocked — so how often
//! the reproducibility bar suppresses a real finding is a SELECT over
//! `proof_of_need_suppression` and not an opinion. `0015_proof_of_need.sql`
//! carries the rules; `agentos_app::proof_of_need` carries how to read the
//! number.
//!
//! **A prospect's booking flow is written by a human and only read by the
//! application.** `0032_prospect_flows.sql` grants `app_role` no INSERT and no
//! UPDATE on `prospect_flows`, so [`set_prospect_flow`] and
//! [`confirm_prospect_flow`] are the only two functions in this file that take
//! an admin transaction. A selector decides which element on somebody else's
//! page a claim gets made about; see [`set_prospect_flow`] for why that is not
//! a thing an employee may write. What an employee *may* write is a
//! [`FlowProposal`] — a different table with full grants, no column that can
//! spell a confirmation, and no path to the constructor that builds a probeable
//! flow. See [`propose_prospect_flow`] and
//! `0037_prospect_flow_proposals.sql`.
//!
//! **Money is [`Money`] on the way in and on the way out**, never a bare
//! integer: minor units plus a currency, converted at the boundary.
//!
//! ponytail: ids are plain [`Uuid`] here rather than domain newtypes, exactly
//! as in `sourcing.rs`; when the revenue id types land in the domain crate
//! these signatures take them and nothing else changes. Stage and segment are
//! `&str` for the same reason — the CHECK constraints in the migration are the
//! authority, and the domain enums map onto them with `as_str()`.
