//! Persistence for the buyer vertical: suppliers, RFQs, quotes, negotiations,
//! purchase orders, shipments.
//!
//! The schema is in `migrations/0007_sourcing.sql` and carries most of the
//! rules; this module is the thin, typed way to reach it. Three things are
//! worth knowing before reading further.
//!
//! **No query in this file filters on `tenant_id`.** Not one. Every function
//! takes a [`TenantTx`], which has already set `app.tenant_id`, so the row-level
//! security policies do the filtering. A `WHERE tenant_id = $n` here would be a
//! second, weaker copy of a rule the database already enforces — and the day
//! someone forgets to write it, the policy is still there.
//!
//! **Money is [`Money`] on the way in and on the way out**, never a bare
//! integer: minor units plus a currency, converted at the boundary. A quote's
//! currency is pinned to its RFQ's currency by a composite foreign key, which
//! is what makes [`live_quotes`]' ordering meaningful — comparing landed prices
//! across currencies is not a ranking.
//!
//! **Reputation is not stored.** [`record_observation`] writes evidence, each
//! row tied to the RFQ or purchase order it happened on, and [`reputation`]
//! reads an aggregate view over that evidence. There is no reputation column to
//! set, so there is no way to assert a supplier is reliable without a record of
//! them being reliable. [`reputation`] returns `None` for a supplier with no
//! observations, because "no data" is an answer and `0%` is a different one.
//!
//! The responsiveness half of that evidence — `quote_returned` and
//! `quote_missed` — has exactly one writer, [`close_expired_rounds`], and it
//! writes both at the same moment for the same reason: an RFQ round is the only
//! event that produces a signal for every supplier it touched, and it produces
//! it when the round ends rather than when an answer lands. Recording the
//! answers as they arrive and the silences separately would be two clocks, and
//! the silences would be the clock nobody wound.
//!
//! ponytail: ids are plain [`Uuid`] here rather than domain newtypes. The
//! sourcing id types live in the domain crate's own unit; when they land, these
//! signatures take them and nothing else changes. Writes for
//! `supplier_contacts` and `shipments` are likewise absent — the tables, their
//! constraints and their indexes exist, and the units that own contact
//! discovery and logistics ingest can add the six-line insert they need.
