//! Daily spend caps that are **reserved**, not merely checked.
//!
//! A cap that is read, compared and then acted on is not a cap. Ten concurrent
//! requests all read "nothing spent yet", all decide they are under the limit,
//! and all pay — which is exactly how an agent structures one large payment
//! into many small ones that each pass on their individual merit. Nothing in
//! the logs looks wrong; every individual decision was correct.
//!
//! So the headroom is consumed under a row lock, in the caller's transaction:
//!
//! ```text
//! caller BEGIN
//!   reserve(..)  ── locks the (tenant, employee, day, currency) bucket row,
//!                   re-reads the running total under that lock, and writes the
//!                   new total before releasing it
//!   insert the payment intent
//! caller COMMIT   ── reservation and payment become visible together
//! ```
//!
//! Because [`reserve`] takes `&mut TenantTx` rather than a pool, it cannot be
//! called outside a transaction, and the lock it takes is held until the caller
//! commits. A crash between the reservation and the payment rolls back both.
//!
//! Three caps, all per currency, because a limit denominated in USD says
//! nothing about a payment in JPY:
//!
//! * **per transaction** — how big any single payment may be;
//! * **daily total** — how much may be reserved in a day;
//! * **daily count** — how many payments may be made in a day, which is the one
//!   that actually stops structuring.
//!
//! No caps row means no spending. Absence fails closed.
