# Operating AgentOS

For someone who did not build this and has to run it.

Everything below was read out of the source, not out of a design doc. Where the
system does less than it looks like it does, this file says so — see
[What is not real yet](#what-is-not-real-yet), and read it before you promise
anything to anybody.

---

## 1. First run, with no credentials at all

This path needs **no API key from anyone**. It is the one to do first, because
if it does not work nothing else will.

You need: Docker, the Rust toolchain pinned in `rust-toolchain.toml` (1.98.0),
`psql`, and — for the `cli` model backend — a `claude` binary already logged in
on your machine. If you have no `claude` binary, use `AGENTOS_LLM=mock` instead
and every employee answers with a canned string that says it is a mock.

### 1.1 Postgres

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

`docker-compose.yml` starts `pgvector/pgvector:pg18` and publishes it on host
port **5442** (offset on purpose, so it does not collide with other Postgres
containers on the same machine). The volume `pgdata` is mounted at
`/var/lib/postgresql` — **not** `.../data`; pg18 refuses to start on the old
path. There is a healthcheck; `docker compose ps` should show `healthy` within
a few seconds.

### 1.2 Environment

```bash
export DATABASE_URL=postgres://postgres:postgres@localhost:5442/agentos
export APP_BIND=0.0.0.0:8090
export PUBLIC_HOST=http://localhost:8090
export AGENT_EMAIL_DOMAIN=agents.example.com
export AGENTOS_MASTER_KEY=$(openssl rand -hex 32)
export AGENTOS_ALLOW_MOCKS=1
export AGENTOS_LLM=cli
export AGENTOS_API_KEYS=ops:00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001:0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
export RUST_LOG=info,agentos_server=debug
```

`AGENTOS_ALLOW_MOCKS=1` is mandatory here and the server tells you so if you
forget it. Every provider adapter in this build is a mock, and the process
**refuses to boot** rather than run one silently — that refusal is the point,
not an inconvenience.

The API-key secret must be at least **32 characters** (`ApiKeys::MIN_SECRET_LEN`);
a shorter one is a boot failure, deliberately, because a short secret is a typo
or a placeholder and both are better found now.

### 1.3 Migrations

You do not run them. `agentos-server` calls `Db::migrate()` on every boot, and
sqlx takes an advisory lock so two replicas starting together serialise instead
of racing. The migration files are **compiled into the binary**
(`sqlx::migrate!("../../migrations")`), so the `migrations/` directory does not
need to be on disk in a deployment.

The connecting role must be able to `CREATE ROLE` and create tables —
`0001_core.sql` creates `app_role`. The compose `postgres` superuser can. See
[§8](#8-the-security-model-in-one-page) for what to do when your production
login role is not a superuser.

If you would rather apply them by hand (the test script does):

```bash
for m in migrations/*.sql; do
  psql "$DATABASE_URL" -v ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f "$m"
done
```

They are written `IF NOT EXISTS` / `DROP`-then-`CREATE` and are replayable.

### 1.4 The tenant, and the key that speaks for it

There are two ways to get a tenant and a credential, and which one you want
depends on whether this box is a single deployment or a control plane.

**a. Over HTTP, with a platform key — the customer-facing way.** Export

```bash
export AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEYS=signup:$(openssl rand -hex 32)
```

and then one call creates the tenant, its active policy version and its first
API key, and returns the secret **once**:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8090/v1/platform/tenants \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $PLATFORM_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slug":"acme","name":"Acme Corp"}'
```

That secret is stored only as an HMAC digest and cannot be recovered. Losing it
means issuing another (`POST /v1/platform/keys`) and revoking this one
(`DELETE /v1/platform/keys/{id}`) — and a revocation takes effect on the **next
request**, with no restart and with every other customer's key untouched.

A platform key names no tenant and can read no tenant's data: presented to
`/v1/whoami` it is a 401. A tenant's key presented to `/v1/platform/*` is also a
401 — a stolen key that could mint another would make revoking it pointless.
`apps/server/src/routes/platform.rs` is the argument in full.

**b. With `DATABASE_URL`, from a shell — the single-deployment way.** Still
supported, still what the rest of this runbook assumes, and the only way when
this box has no platform key. **There is no *tenant-authenticated* endpoint that
creates a tenant, and there cannot be one.** Every route derives its tenant from
the API key, so the key for a tenant that does not exist yet cannot authorise
creating it. `AGENTOS_API_KEYS` names a tenant UUID;
`employees.tenant_id` has a foreign key to `tenants(id)` — one of fifty that do.
If the row is missing, the first write answers `400 unknown_tenant` and names
this section; it used to fail on the FK as `500 internal` with the cause only in
the server log, which is where the twenty minutes went. `SPEC.md` §20 is the
route table, and it is not complete.

```bash
agentos-server policy new-tenant acme Acme \
  --id 00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001
```

`--id` because your `AGENTOS_API_KEYS` entry already carries that UUID; leave it
off and one is minted and printed. It reads `DATABASE_URL` and nothing else, and
runs as the connecting role — `tenants` is granted `SELECT` only to `app_role`
and there is no path to it from a `tenant_tx`.

**It writes two rows, and the second one is the point.** A tenant also needs an
**active `policy_versions` row**, because `store::policy::load` joins on
`v.active`: a tenant without one has *invisible* layers. Every limit you write
for it is skipped, every scope falls back to inheriting the ceiling, and nothing
errors — the rows are in the table and the gate has never read one. That version
had no writer at all until this command, which is why the two rows are one
transaction and cannot be asked for separately.

### 1.4b Tenant, role and employee limits

`policy install --tenant` writes them, one layer per invocation, each as a new
active policy version:

```bash
agentos-server policy install --tenant $TENANT --role purchasing purchasing.json
agentos-server policy rollback --tenant $TENANT       # undo the last one
```

The document must be a **complete** `PolicyLimits` — the layers intersect, so an
omitted field is *deny*, not "leave it alone", and the installer refuses a
document that omits one. `docs/TEAMS.md` §2 has the shape and the warning.

### 1.4c A prospect's booking flow, if you are running the seller

The sales vertical probes a prospect's own booking page and reports what it
said. It needs to know **where the fields are** — an entry URL and five CSS
selectors — and there is no way to work that out safely: a selector aimed at an
element that does not exist fails loudly, but one aimed at the *wrong* element
resolves, reads the same text on both runs, passes the reproducibility bar and
gets screenshotted into an email telling a company what its own checkout said.

So a person writes them, and a person's name is what makes them usable:

```bash
agentos-server flow set --tenant $TENANT --account $ACCOUNT flow.json
agentos-server flow confirm --tenant $TENANT --account $ACCOUNT --by "Your Name"
```

`$ACCOUNT` is `accounts.id`. `flow.json` is:

```json
{
  "entry_url": "https://book.example.com/entry-requirements",
  "passport_field": "#passport",
  "destination_field": "#destination",
  "date_field": "#travel-date",
  "submit": "#check",
  "panel": "#visa-info"
}
```

`date_field` and `submit` are optional. `submit` is their **check requirements**
button and never a booking or payment submit — nothing in this system can tell
those apart. `entry_url` must be https and on the account's own domain.

Three things follow from the confirmation being the point:

* **`set` always leaves the row unconfirmed**, and re-running it on a confirmed
  row clears the confirmation. A selector nobody has looked at is a selector
  nobody has looked at.
* **An unconfirmed flow is not skipped**, it is the head of the queue and the
  seller returns `flow_unconfirmed` naming the account until somebody confirms
  it. That is deliberate: a bulk-loaded guess that quietly waited its turn is
  the guess that eventually gets probed.
* **The domain has to be on the employee's `allowed_domains`** (§1.4b), or the
  seller answers `domain_not_allowed` naming the domain. Also not a skip.

Both verbs read `DATABASE_URL` and nothing else, for §1.4's reason. The running
server has no INSERT or UPDATE on this table at all.

### 1.4d Prospect lists

The third subcommand, and the only one that writes tenant *data* rather than
limits:

```bash
agentos-server import --tenant $TENANT --segment relocation --country PH \
  --dry-run list.csv        # every judgement, nothing committed
```

It loads Smartlead-shaped CSVs (`email,first_name,last_name,company_name,
phone_number,website,linkedin_profile,location`) into `accounts` and `contacts`,
which have no other writer outside tests. Several files are one transaction, and
running the same file twice writes nothing the second time — a prospect is its
domain and a person is their address, both already unique per tenant.

It reads `DATABASE_URL` and nothing else, for the same reason `policy` does plus
one: the lists are on the operator's disk, and a route would mean uploading a
thousand people's contact details to a server that has no reason to hold them.

**It drops three things and prints a count of each every run** — a
`linkedin_profile` (no column anywhere), a phone that is not E.164 (the CHECK
that lets the suppression list match by equality), and any country name it was
not given as ISO-2 (the location string is kept verbatim instead). An address on
the suppression list is skipped and never re-activated. `docs/ORIZN.md` §8 is the
column-by-column table and `agentos_app::prospects` is the argument for each.

### 1.4e The file you upload — the other end of the same pipeline

`import` puts prospects in. This takes them out, in the shape Smartlead loads:

```bash
curl -sX POST -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
     -H "Idempotency-Key: $(uuidgen)" \
     "$HOST/v1/employees/$EMPLOYEE/queue/export" | jq -r .csv > leads.csv
```

Ten columns: the import's eight plus `objet_email` and `angle_email`, which are
the subject and body of an opener rendered from a **reproduced** finding about
that prospect's own booking flow. A row cannot exist without one — that is a
type, not a review step.

Four things to know before running it every morning:

* **It is a write.** Everyone in the file is marked contacted, with the next
  follow-up 72 hours out, committed *before* the bytes reach you. Run it twice
  and the second file is empty; that is the point, and it is why the verb is
  `POST`.
* **Keep the `Idempotency-Key`.** If the response is lost — proxy timeout, a
  dropped connection — retrying with the *same* key replays the exact same
  bytes. A new key gets a new (probably empty) export, and the openers in the
  lost one wait 72 hours.
* **The size is `max_new_contacts_per_day` minus whoever was already written to
  today**, from the same intersected policy the gate enforces (§1.5). The sales
  pack ships that at `0`, so a fresh deployment exports an empty file until an
  operator raises it. The response says `budget` and `spent_today` so you can
  tell "nobody was due" from "the limit is zero".
* **A 200 with just a header row is a normal morning.** Nothing was fresh, or
  the day is spent. Findings older than seven days are left out rather than
  re-asserted: the opener names a date and tells the prospect how to check it.

The employee id picks *whose limits*; the tenant always comes from the API key,
and another tenant's employee id is a 404.

From 2026-09-01 the same slice goes to Smartlead's API instead of to your
clipboard. Nothing above changes except where the bytes land.

### 1.5 The policy ceiling you have to install

**This is the step that decides whether the deployment does anything at all.**

The Policy Gate reads its limits out of `policy_layers` on every decision and
takes the strictest of four layers — platform ∧ tenant ∧ role ∧ employee. The
top one, the **platform ceiling** (`tenant_id IS NULL`), is the only layer with
nothing above it to inherit from, so its absence is not "unrestricted", it is
"no policy". With no ceiling `store::policy::load` answers `NoPlatformLayer` and
**every action for every tenant is denied** with `no_platform_policy`: no email
leaves, no payment is proposed, no employee takes a turn.

A fresh database has no ceiling. Install one:

```bash
agentos-server policy install
# or, from the repo: cargo run -p agentos-server -- policy install
```

It reads `DATABASE_URL` and nothing else. That is deliberate and it is the whole
authorisation story: the platform layer belongs to no tenant, every route in this
server derives its tenant from the API key, and a platform-wide write authorised
by one tenant's key would be a privilege escalation with a JSON body. The
operator's proof of authority here is the database credential — so this is a
subcommand and not an endpoint. The argument in full is in
`apps/server/src/policy.rs`.

It needs the schema, so run it **after** the first boot (which migrates — §1.3);
if you run it first it tells you so. No restart afterwards: the gate reads the
ceiling per decision, so `/readyz` goes green on the next probe.

**The default ceiling, and why each number.** It is a *ceiling* — the widest
anything in this deployment may be — and not a recommendation. It is also, until
somebody writes a tenant layer, the effective policy of every tenant, because an
absent layer inherits the one above it.

| | default | why |
|---|---|---|
| per transaction | **$500** | one unattended payment, the size of a routine invoice or a renewal: useful, and recoverable when it is wrong |
| approval threshold | **$100** | the "nobody looks" line — at or above it a human presses the button |
| per day | **$2 000** | the structuring guard, four transactions wide |
| channels | **email, internal, web** | email is what the product is for, internal never leaves the process, web is the console. SMS/WhatsApp/voice reach a phone (two of them have no adapter in this build); A2A talks to somebody else's agent. Per-deployment decisions, not defaults |
| calling codes | **none** | follows from the above: a country list under no phone channel grants nothing |
| domains, MCP tools, A2A peers | **none — i.e. denied** | there is no wildcard domain to write (a `Domain` needs two labels and matches by label suffix) and no universal tool or peer. Naming them is a deployment's own decision, and this is the surface where a model is reading attacker-controlled text |
| new contacts/day | **50** | a working day of deliberate first contacts, well under what gets a sending domain blocklisted |
| turns/day | **200** | the only limit on an employee that never spends money: ~one wake every seven minutes, above any human-paced workload, and a bound on what a wedged initiative loop costs overnight |
| uploads, credential changes, data deletion | **off** | an upload is the exfiltration primitive; a credential change rotates a secret the deployment depends on; deleting a conversation is the one flag that makes erasing customer data unattended |

**To widen it** — and only the operator can — save the JSON the command printed,
edit it, and install that:

```bash
agentos-server policy install ceiling.json
```

Everything below the ceiling can only narrow it. A tenant, team or employee layer
naming a bigger number does not get a bigger number; it gets the ceiling's. That
is `EffectivePolicy::try_new`, which takes the minimum of every cap and the
intersection of every allowlist, and there is no read path that skips it.

**It is idempotent and versioned.** Installing the same ceiling twice does not
create a second version — the second run prints `unchanged` and writes nothing,
so a deploy script can run it every time. Anything different becomes a new
active version, and the old one stays in `policy_versions`:

```bash
agentos-server policy rollback     # the previous ceiling is active again
```

Rollback is a pointer flip, so it restores exactly what was there — nothing is
edited in place and nothing is deleted. Rolling back the *first* ceiling is
refused: it would leave the deployment denying everything, which is not an undo.

Limits for one tenant, team or employee are still SQL — see `docs/TEAMS.md` §2.
The ceiling is the part that had no path at all.

### 1.6 Boot and check

```bash
cargo run -p agentos-server
```

The first lines on stdout are JSON. Three of them matter:

* `RUNNING WITH MOCK ADAPTERS — these providers do nothing real.` — expected
  here, and a bug anywhere you care about.
* `NO PLATFORM POLICY LAYER: …` — on the very first boot, before §1.5. The
  process starts anyway (a crash loop would leave you nothing to read) and
  refuses every action until you install a ceiling.
* `listening` with the bind address.

Then, from another shell:

```bash
KEY=0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef

curl -s localhost:8090/livez                      # -> ok
curl -s localhost:8090/readyz   # -> {"ready":true,"outbox_lag_secs":0,"mock_adapters":[…],"payment_rail":false}
# ...but 503 with `"code":"no_platform_policy"` until §1.5 has been run — the
# error bodies are problem+json, see §/readyz below.
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" localhost:8090/v1/whoami
# -> {"tenant_id":"00000000-...-0001","actor":"ops"}

curl -s -X POST localhost:8090/v1/employees \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  -H "Idempotency-Key: first-hire-001" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"slug":"lena","domain":"agents.example.com"}'
# -> 202 Accepted, with an id
```

`Idempotency-Key` is **required** on employee creation and only there. Creation
mints billable resources; a retry without a key is a second employee with a
second set of them.

Then watch it provision:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" localhost:8090/v1/employees/<id> | jq
```

On mocks the ten steps that have an adapter land within a couple of seconds,
`lifecycle` becomes `active`, and `health` settles at **`degraded`** — not
`online`. That is correct: `whatsapp` fails with `no_whatsapp_sender` on every
deployment today ([§9](#what-is-not-real-yet)), and `health` is derived from all
eleven rows on every read.

The four `health` values, and what each is derived from:

| value | means |
|---|---|
| `provisioning` | a **blocking** step (`identity`, `email`, `vault`, `permissions`) is not ready yet |
| `failed` | a blocking step is in terminal failure — the employee cannot work |
| `degraded` | everything blocking is ready, but an optional channel is still in flight, waiting or broken (**or** the lifecycle is not `active`) |
| `online` | everything blocking is ready and nothing optional is outstanding |

An optional step deliberately turned off (`disabled`) does not degrade anything;
one that is `failed`, `pending` or `pending_external` does.

### 1.7 The test suite

```bash
docker compose up -d
./scripts/test.sh
```

Not `cargo test --workspace`. The integration tests talk to a real Postgres and
cargo runs each package's test binary in parallel; several tests are
cross-tenant by nature (the outbox poller reads every tenant's rows — that is
its job), so two packages sharing one database see each other's fixtures and
fail for reasons that have nothing to do with the code. `scripts/test.sh`
creates one database per package, named `ci_<package>_<run id>`
(`ci_agentosdomain_…`, `ci_agentosstore_…`), applies the migrations, and runs
each package's tests. The run id is the shell's PID folded with the checkout:
fixed names meant two concurrent runs dropped each other's databases mid-suite.
There is no `--test-threads=1` any more: the tests isolate themselves, and serialising them
only hid that.

Two guards, both deliberate. It **refuses to start** without `psql` and a
reachable Postgres, and it **refuses to finish** if any test skipped itself —
dozens of fixtures opt out silently without a database
(`grep -rn 'SKIP: ' crates apps` for how many today), which makes a run green
and empty.

`crates/eval` runs last, outside the per-package database loop, because it opens
no connection.

Honour `PGHOST` / `PGPORT` / `PGUSER` / `PGPASSWORD`; it defaults to
`localhost:5442` with `postgres`/`postgres`.

---

## 2. Every environment variable

Read in exactly one place: `apps/server/src/config.rs`. Nothing else in the
binary calls `std::env::var`. A required variable that is missing is a boot
failure whose message names the variable.

An **exported-but-empty** variable (`export DATABASE_URL=`) counts as missing.
That is deliberate.

### Required — the process will not start without them

| Variable | What it is | What breaks without it |
|---|---|---|
| `DATABASE_URL` | Postgres connection string | `refusing to start: DATABASE_URL is not set…` |
| `PUBLIC_HOST` | The origin this deployment is reachable at, **including scheme** | Boot failure. It is interpolated into the A2A agent card's `url` (`{PUBLIC_HOST}/a2a/jsonrpc?employee=…`), so a wrong value means peers call nowhere. There is no defensible default. |
| `AGENT_EMAIL_DOMAIN` | Domain employee addresses are minted under | Boot failure |
| `AGENTOS_MASTER_KEY` | Envelope-encryption root key | Boot failure. **It is read, and it is load-bearing:** every employee's Ed25519 private key is sealed under it. Validated only as "non-empty" — it is not hex-decoded or length-checked at boot despite what `.env.example` implies, and it is bridged to 32 bytes by SHA-256, not a KDF, because the input is a secret with full entropy rather than a password. Losing it is unrecoverable ([§10](#10-backup-and-restore)). |

### Optional, with defaults

| Variable | Default | Consequence of leaving it |
|---|---|---|
| `APP_BIND` | `0.0.0.0:8080` | Note the mismatch: `.env.example` and the README use **8090**. Unset means 8080. A value that is not `host:port` is a boot failure. |
| `RUST_LOG` | `info,agentos_server=debug` | Logs are JSON on stdout either way (`tracing_subscriber::fmt().json()`). |
| `AGENTOS_LLM` | `mock` | The scripted mock answers every message with `MOCK_REPLY`, which says out loud that it is a mock. An unknown value is a boot failure that lists the valid ones — it never silently falls back. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | — | Required **at boot** when `AGENTOS_LLM=anthropic`; missing it is a named boot failure, so the first inbound email is never where you find out. |
| `AGENTOS_ALLOW_MOCKS` | unset (false) | `1` / `true` / `yes` permits mock adapters. Anything else, plus any mock, is `refusing to start`. |
| `AGENTOS_API_KEYS` | empty | The operators' keyring, consulted **before** the `api_keys` table so a row cannot shadow it. Empty is fine when `AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEYS` is set; empty *and* no platform key means every request is 401 and nothing can issue one, which the server warns about at boot. Format: `label:tenant-uuid:secret[,…]`. The label becomes the audit actor and — see [§7](#7-approvals) — the caller's *role*. Secret ≥ 32 chars. |
| `AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEYS` | empty | **`/v1/platform/*` is 401 to everybody**, so nobody can sign up and no key can be issued or revoked without a redeploy. Format: `label:secret[,…]` — no tenant uuid, deliberately. Secret ≥ 32 chars. |
| `AGENTOS_METRICS_KEY` | empty | **`GET /metrics` is 401 to everybody**, Prometheus included — the fail-closed default, because the page publishes the deny-reason mix and the approval-queue depth. One bare secret, no label and no tenant: it is neither of the two keyrings above, and deliberately not the platform key, which mints and revokes tenant credentials. Present it as `Authorization: Bearer <secret>`; secret ≥ 32 chars or it is a boot failure. `/livez` and `/readyz` are unaffected and stay open. |
| `AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` | empty | Empty **and** an empty `webhook_endpoints` table means every `/v1/webhooks/{path}` is a 404 and no inbound message can ever arrive. The server warns when the variable is empty. Format: `provider:tenant-uuid:signing-secret[,…]`; the secret may contain colons (`whsec_…` ones do). Consulted **before** the table so a row cannot shadow it. Holds **one tenant per provider** — two entries on one path is a boot failure; register the second customer with `POST /v1/platform/webhooks`. |
| `AGENTOS_OAUTH_CLIENTS` | empty | **No connector is advertised by `GET /v1/mcp/catalog`**, so nobody can start an OAuth flow and nobody clicks a button that cannot work. Deployment scope and never tenant scope: a `client_secret` identifies *this product* to a provider, so it is the same value for every customer. Format: `connector:client_id:client_secret[,…]`; a malformed entry is a boot failure naming the position and never the value. This table said it was every variable while this one was missing from it. |
| `MCP_BRIDGE_BIND` | unset | **Hosted MCP is off**: no bridge runtime is built and every binding on a hosted connector refuses with `hosting_unavailable`, while `POST /v1/mcp/connect` answers 503 for one. Set it to the address bridges publish on — `127.0.0.1` on a development box, the host's address on your bridge subnet in production. The network `accept` admits is **derived** from it as its own `/32` (or `/128`), so there is no second variable to disagree with this one. |
| `MCP_BRIDGES_PER_TENANT` | `0` | How many hosted servers one tenant may have started on one bind pass. **Zero means an address alone starts nothing** — `POST /v1/mcp/connect` answers 409 `hosted_cap_reached` and the binder asks no runtime. The number is an operator's arithmetic, not a programmer's: box memory ÷ resident size of one runner ÷ tenants per box, then divided again by `bridge::IDLE ÷ 5 min` (currently 4), because a bridge is leased and a tenant holds more containers than rows while a lease runs out. |
| `MCP_BRIDGE_IMAGE` | `node:22-alpine` | The runner image. The default fetches the pinned stdio package and the pinned gateway with `npx` at container start, which costs a slow first bind per host and no build pipeline. Point it at your own image to move that to build time — or because `supergateway`, the only npm package doing stdio → Streamable HTTP, publishes no licence. |
| `EMAIL_API_KEY` | — | Unset runs `MockEmailProvider`. Set to the `re_…` key, it **builds the real Resend client**. |
| `TELEPHONY_API_KEY` | — | Unset runs `MockTelephony`. Set to `ACxxxx:auth_token` — Twilio authenticates with both halves together — it **builds the real Twilio client**. Half of it is a boot failure. |
| `BROWSER_API_KEY` | — | Unset runs `MockBrowser`. Set to `project-id:api-key`, it **builds the real Browserbase client with a live CDP driver**. Half of it is a boot failure. |

These are the `PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS` table in `config.rs`. Each is read once,
and that one read both decides the guard and builds the client — they cannot
disagree. Selection is **per adapter**: one set and two unset is a normal
deployment, not an error.

The email adapter also needs the `whsec_…` signing secret and takes it from the
`email` entry of `AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS`, and its sending domain from
`AGENT_EMAIL_DOMAIN`. Neither has a variable of its own.

`EMBEDDER_API_KEY` is a row here again, and the reason it was deleted is worth
knowing before you set it. It used to be the guard's own version of the failure
the guard exists to prevent: exporting any string turned the alarm off while
`Embedder` still had one variant and it was still a SHA-256 hash. It selects a
real client now — `OpenAiEmbedder`, on the customer's own key,
`text-embedding-3-small` — so the alarm it quiets is an alarm about something
that became real. One value, not a pair: the model name is a constant of the
adapter, because the HNSW index is partial on it. The employee secret vault is
no longer a mock at all: it is `secrets=local-envelope(aes-256-gcm)` in the boot
line, selected by `AGENTOS_MASTER_KEY` like every other use of that key.

**Setting it does not re-embed what is already stored.** Every chunk records the
model it was embedded under and every search binds one model, so a corpus
ingested on the hash keeps `mock-sha256-1536` and stops being findable until it
is ingested again. That is deliberate — the alternative is comparing a SHA-256
digest with a sentence embedding and reporting a score — but it is a migration
of the customer's documents, not a restart.

### What a boot says about its adapters

Every boot, real or not, logs one line:

```
adapters: email=resend telephony=MOCK browser=browserbase embedder=openai
          llm=anthropic secrets=local-envelope(aes-256-gcm)
```

`/readyz` publishes the same thing as `mock_adapters`, so the question survives
the log rotation:

```json
{"ready": true, "outbox_lag_secs": 0, "mock_adapters": ["telephony"],
 "payment_rail": false}
```

`payment_rail` is beside it and is not one of the mocks: those have a credential
that makes them real, and this one has no adapter in the workspace to configure
at all. It is `false` on every build today, and it is the same port
`POST /v1/approvals/{id}/approve` refuses a `payment_create` on — so a replica
can be asked whether an approval will be spendable *before* someone presses the
button. Neither field fails the probe.

### What the boot refusal looks like

```
agentos-server: refusing to start: email, browser would run as mocks and do
nothing real, and nobody said that was acceptable (set EMAIL_API_KEY,
BROWSER_API_KEY for the real thing, or AGENTOS_ALLOW_MOCKS=1 to accept exactly
these). Adapters would be: email=MOCK telephony=twilio browser=MOCK
embedder=openai llm=anthropic secrets=local-envelope(aes-256-gcm)
```

The inventory is in the refusal as well as in a successful boot, because the
boot that does *not* happen is the one you most need it for: it shows that the
Twilio integration you landed last week is fine and the browser variable has a
typo in it.

Half a compound credential stops the boot by name instead:

```
agentos-server: refusing to start: TELEPHONY_API_KEY is not usable: must be
`ACxxxxxxxx:auth_token — console.twilio.com shows both`, and both halves are
required
```

The config `Debug` rendering is hand-written and redacts `DATABASE_URL`,
`AGENTOS_MASTER_KEY`, every API key and every webhook secret. The `starting`
log line is safe to paste into a ticket.

## 3. The five loops

One binary, five `tokio` tasks, no separate workers. All five hang off one
`CancellationToken` cancelled by SIGTERM or SIGINT, so they drain *alongside*
the HTTP listener rather than after it.

| Loop | Poll | Batch |
|---|---|---|
| `mcp` | 300s, plus event-driven rebinds | — |
| `provisioning` | 200ms | 32 |
| `outbox` | 250ms idle | 32 |
| `inbound` | 250ms idle | 8 |
| `initiative` | 5s | 4 |

### 3.1 provisioning — `apps/server/src/loops/provisioning.rs`

Polls every **200ms**. Owns three jobs that share one tick:

**Converge.** Claims employees with a resource row that wants work, and hands
each to `ProvisioningEngine`, which runs the eleven steps in dependency order
under a lease. Four things count as "wants work", and each is a different
failure:

| row state | why it is work |
|---|---|
| `pending` | never attempted |
| `provisioning` with `lease_until < now` | **a worker died holding it** |
| `pending_external` with `expected_by < now` | the wait is now a problem |
| `failed`, cold for 30s, under 5 attempts | a transient failure |

The second row is the recovery case and the reason the claim is not simply
`state = 'pending'`.

**Reap.** A step stuck in `pending_external` past its `expected_by` gets an
approval filed (actor `provisioning-reaper`, role `operator`, TTL 7 days) and is
moved to `failed`, so it stops looking like a wait that is still going somewhere.
The reason string names the `poll_ref` — the Twilio bundle sid, say. Guarded so a
200ms poll does not file 18,000 approvals a day for one bundle.

**Sweep.** The standing question *"is anybody still holding something they were
told to give back?"*, asked of the database rather than of an event. See
[§6](#6-stranded-resources).

### 3.2 outbox — `apps/server/src/loops/outbox.rs`

This is what replaces a broker. Claims batches of **32** from `outbox_events`
with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, sleeps **250ms** when it finds nothing, and goes
straight back round when the batch comes back full.

Two transactions, and the split matters. The claim commits *before* any handler
runs — `SKIP LOCKED` only hides a row while the claiming transaction is open, so
holding it across a handler would mean holding a row lock across a network call.
What keeps the row to one worker instead is that the claim pushed `available_at`
into the future: a lease that expires by itself, so a poller that dies mid-handler
hands the row back with no reaper involved.

The handler then runs in a **tenant** transaction, under RLS, and
`mark_done` runs inside that same transaction — so "the effect happened" and
"the event is done" cannot disagree.

Delivery is **at-least-once**, knowingly. A process killed between a provider
accepting an email and the `COMMIT` sends it twice. Handlers are expected to be
idempotent; `provider_intents` is what narrows the window.

Registered handlers live in `apps/server/src/main.rs::handlers`. **An event type
with no handler is failed, not skipped** — retried eight times, then
dead-lettered. That is correct behaviour and it makes that function load-bearing:
if you add an `enqueue` anywhere, add a line there.

The outbox claim deliberately **excludes** `aggregate_type = 'inbound'`, because
the inbound loop owns those rows.

### 3.3 inbound — `apps/server/src/loops/inbound.rs`

A second poller with its own claim, filtered to `aggregate_type = 'inbound'`.
It exists separately because its work is *someone else's*: two provider round
trips per row, and failure modes like "the body is not there yet". Draining it
on its own claim keeps a provider outage from sitting in front of a queue of
approvals.

The two-phase fetch is on a clock: a webhook carries metadata only, the body is
fetched here, and attachment bytes are fetched **immediately after** the body
because the provider's `download_url` dies an hour after it is minted.

Three outcomes:

* **landed** — `mark_done`; the `messages` row and its `agent.turn.requested`
  event commit together.
* **retryable** — `mark_failed`, and the claim's own backoff hands it back.
* **terminal** (a payload no build can parse, an address nobody owns) —
  *parked*: the error is written down and the attempt counter is burned out, so
  the row stays in `outbox_events`, unpublished, and shows up as a dead letter.
  Retrying forever would spin; deleting would lose a customer's email.

### 3.4 initiative — `apps/server/src/loops/initiative.rs`

Polls every **5s**, claims up to **4** employees whose cadence is due, and starts
a self-directed agent turn for each. This is the loop that makes an employee do
something nobody asked it to do this minute, so it is the one with the most
brakes on it.

It reschedules at **claim** time, not at success, so a crash mid-turn is not a
hot loop. The next time carries up to 10% jitter, computed in SQL, so a fleet on
one cadence does not stampede.

Before any model call it **reserves a turn** against `turn_buckets` — see §3.6 —
and it is the only write path that reads `policy_layers`. It runs the turn with
**no untrusted content and no knowledge recall**: the context is the employee's
charter and nothing else.

Outcomes are written to `employee_initiative.last_outcome` and are a closed
vocabulary: `no_charter`, `unreadable_charter`, `no_model`, `clarify`,
`no_work`, `turn`, `error`, `over_budget`. `clarify` means the charter has a gap
and the loop wrote the question down instead of spending a turn guessing — read
`last_detail`.

**`last_outcome` is about the beat `last_claimed_at` names, and NULL means that
beat said nothing.** The claim empties the column when it takes a beat up and
only the record at the end of the turn puts a word back, so a worker killed
mid-turn leaves NULL rather than the previous beat's answer. Read the two
columns together:

* `claims = 0` — never acted. Set a cadence, or the employee is not `active`.
* `last_outcome` set — that is what the last beat did, and `last_claimed_at` is
  when.
* **`last_outcome` NULL with `claims > 0` and `last_claimed_at` seconds ago** —
  a turn is running. Normal.
* **`last_outcome` NULL with `claims > 0` and `last_claimed_at` a whole cadence
  ago** — the beat never came back. The worker died between the claim and the
  record, or the record itself failed; `grep` the log for
  `initiative outcome was not recorded`. If `claims` keeps climbing and the
  column keeps coming back NULL, every beat is dying.

```sql
SELECT employee_id, interval_secs, next_at, claims,
       last_claimed_at, last_outcome, last_detail
FROM   employee_initiative ORDER BY next_at;
```

### 3.5 mcp — `apps/server/src/routes/mcp.rs::run`

Rebinds every tenant's MCP fleets on a **300s** tick, plus immediately on a
nudge from an operator write. Binding is a loop and not a boot step because an
MCP endpoint that is down must not delay a listener that has nothing else wrong
with it.

### 3.6 The turn budget, and what "over budget" means

`max_turns_per_day` is a column on `policy_layers`, intersected by `.min()` like
every other cap, and it **defaults to 0** — an employee may not act on its own
until somebody writes a layer that says it may. There is no env var for it.

It counts turns, not tokens, because the provider counts tokens and no reliable
count exists *before* the call — the only moment a cap can refuse anything. It
is reserved before the model call and **there is no release verb**: a turn that
started already spent its tokens, and a release path is the path a crash loop
rides.

Exactly one operator alert fires, on the reservation that takes the last slot —
exactly-once falls out of the row lock, not a flag column. **No operator action
is needed to restart it.** The day is UTC and the budget resets itself at
midnight.

Read an employee's position:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  localhost:8090/v1/employees/<id>/turns | jq
# {"employee_id":"…","day":"2026-08-25","turns_taken":4,
#  "max_turns_per_day":8,"turns_remaining":4,"exhausted":false}
```

An unknown or another tenant's id is **404**, not 403.

### 3.6b The model allowlist, and what "no_model" means

`allowed_models` is the other half of the bill, on the same table and with the
same intersection: platform ∧ tenant ∧ role ∧ employee, narrowing only. Turns
say how *often* an employee thinks; this says *what it thinks with*, and the two
models at the ends of the list differ by ten times per token.

Each role pack names the model its job needs — that is a preference, in code —
and this column bounds what the deployment will pay for. What runs is the
intersection, resolved once when the turn is assembled:

* **preference permitted** → it runs;
* **preference excluded, something else permitted** → the *cheapest* permitted
  model runs, and the substitution is logged at `INFO` with the role, the
  preference and what it fell to. Never a more expensive one;
* **nothing permitted** → **no turn happens.** The initiative loop records
  `last_outcome = 'no_model'` with the role and preference in `last_detail`; the
  message handler fails the turn with a sentence saying it is not a provider
  failure. There is no fallback model, and retrying will not help — the fix is a
  policy layer.

`AGENTOS_LLM` still selects the *backend* (`mock` / `cli` / `anthropic`) and no
longer selects a model; there was a process-wide model string and it is gone.
Under `cli` the deployment is on a subscription, where the rate card is the wrong
currency entirely and the binding constraint is throughput — the allowlist still
applies, because `--model` still selects which model the subscription serves.

```sql
SELECT layer, role_name, allowed_models FROM policy_layers l
  JOIN policy_versions v ON v.id = l.version_id WHERE v.active;
```

### 3.7 Shutdown

SIGTERM or SIGINT cancels the token. In-flight HTTP requests get **20s**
(`DRAIN_DEADLINE`); the loops then get a further **5s** (`LOOP_DRAIN_DEADLINE`)
and are **aborted** past it — a pod that will not die is worse than one that
drops a lease, and whatever it was doing is a row in Postgres whose lease
expires.

`DRAIN_DEADLINE + LOOP_DRAIN_DEADLINE` = 25s must fit inside your orchestrator's
grace period. Kubernetes defaults to 30s, which is why they are 20 and 5.

An in-flight agent turn is cancelled **between effects, never inside one**, and
each turn is capped at `TURN_DEADLINE` = 120s.

---

## 4. `/livez` versus `/readyz`

Both sit **outside** the API-key layer. A probe that needs a credential is a
probe that reports an outage the day the keyring is misconfigured.

### `/livez`

```
200 ok
```

Unconditional. The process is running and the runtime is scheduling. It never
touches the database.

**Wire your orchestrator's *liveness* probe here and nothing else.** Conflating
it with readiness is how a pod that is merely waiting on a slow database gets
killed and restarted into the same slow database, now with a cold pool.

### `/readyz`

```json
{"ready": true, "outbox_lag_secs": 0, "mock_adapters": [], "payment_rail": false}
```

or, and **these bodies are RFC 9457 problem details** — `application/problem+json`,
the reason is in `code`, never in an `error` key, which is what this block used
to show:

```json
503 {"type":"/problems/database","title":"this replica is not ready","status":503,"code":"database"}
503 {"type":"/problems/no_platform_policy","title":"this replica is not ready","status":503,"code":"no_platform_policy"}
503 {"type":"/problems/outbox_lag","title":"this replica is not ready","status":503,"code":"outbox_lag"}
```

So the thing to alert on is `.code`, and `jq -r .code` is the one-liner.
`apps/server/src/error.rs` builds every error body in this system the same way.

Three questions, one round trip each:

1. **Can we get a connection, against a migrated schema?** `database` if not.
   Not a separate migration check: both queries below read tables that only the
   migrations create, so an un-migrated database answers `42P01` and this
   refuses.
2. **Is there a platform policy ceiling?** `no_platform_policy` if not — the
   gate is fail-closed, so a replica without one serves 200s and refuses every
   piece of work, which is the shape of outage nobody pages on. The fix is
   §1.5, and the reason string is the gate's own deny code, so the probe and the
   metric say the same word.
3. **Is the outbox draining?** `outbox_lag` if the oldest *due, unpublished,
   still-retryable* event is more than **300s** old (`MAX_OUTBOX_LAG_SECS`).

A wedged outbox means side effects are being accepted and not performed, which
is worse than refusing the request — hence a readiness failure and not just a
log line.

Two things `readyz` deliberately does **not** count as lag:

* An event backed off into the future. That is the backoff working.
* A **dead letter**. Its `available_at` is permanently in the past, so counting
  it would make the number climb without bound — one poison message would take
  every replica out of rotation forever, with no way back. Dead letters are an
  *alert*, not a readiness signal. See [§5](#5-dead-letters).

Reading it:

| symptom | what it means |
|---|---|
| `livez` 200, `readyz` 503 `database` | Postgres is unreachable or the pool is exhausted. Do not restart the pod; fix the database. |
| `livez` 200, `readyz` 503 `no_platform_policy` | No policy ceiling: this replica would deny every action. Run `agentos-server policy install` ([§1.5](#15-the-policy-ceiling-you-have-to-install)). No restart needed. |
| `livez` 200, `readyz` 503 `outbox_lag` | The poller is behind or wedged. Check for a handler that is failing every time — look at `last_error` on the oldest unpublished row. |
| `readyz` 200 with a big `outbox_lag_secs` | A backlog that is draining. Watch the number, not the status. |
| `livez` not answering | The runtime is blocked or the process is gone. This one is a restart. |

---

## 5. Dead letters

### What one is

`outbox_events` has no dead-letter table and no dead-letter flag. A dead letter
is a row where `published_at IS NULL AND attempt_count >= 8` (`MAX_ATTEMPTS`) —
the same predicate `claim` filters on, read back. Nothing moves the row; it just
stops being selected.

**A dead letter is a side effect that was supposed to happen and never did.**
An email that was never sent. A resource that was never released. A customer's
message that never became a turn.

The backoff before it gets there is `2^attempt` seconds, capped at an hour,
multiplied by a random factor in `[0.5, 1.5)`, counted **at claim time** so a
worker killed mid-handler still burns an attempt. Eight attempts is roughly two
hours of retrying.

### Finding them

There is **no HTTP endpoint**. `agentos_store::outbox::dead_letters` is the
library function; from `psql` it is:

```sql
SELECT id, tenant_id, aggregate_type, aggregate_id, event_type,
       attempt_count, available_at, last_error
FROM   outbox_events
WHERE  published_at IS NULL AND attempt_count >= 8
ORDER  BY available_at
LIMIT  100;
```

Poll that from an alert. `last_error` is the handler's own text and is written
for exactly this moment — the handler contract says so.

Also grep the logs for:

```
outbox event dead-lettered; this side effect will not happen
```

which is emitted at `error` with the aggregate type and id on it.

### Clearing one

Decide first *whether the effect should still happen*. It has been at least two
hours; sending a two-hour-old auto-reply may be worse than not sending it.

**To retry it** — reset the attempt counter and make it due:

```sql
UPDATE outbox_events
   SET attempt_count = 0,
       available_at  = now(),
       last_error    = NULL
 WHERE id = '<event-id>';
```

The poller picks it up within 250ms. Do this only once you have fixed whatever
made it fail eight times, or you are buying two more hours of retries.

**To abandon it** — mark it published without running it:

```sql
UPDATE outbox_events
   SET published_at = now()
 WHERE id = '<event-id>';
```

The row stays, with its `last_error`, as the record that the effect was
deliberately dropped. Prefer this to `DELETE`.

**If the cause was a missing handler** (`last_error` contains
`no handler is registered for this event type`) the fix is in
`main.rs::handlers`, not in the database. Add the row, deploy, then reset the
counter as above.

### The one dead letter with a second safety net

An `employee.terminated` event that dead-letters would leave provider resources
bought and billed forever with nothing retrying. That is what the provisioning
loop's **sweep** exists for — see next section. It is the only failure path in
the system with a standing second reader.

---

## 6. Stranded resources

A *stranded* resource is one a terminated employee is still bound to, and still
being billed for.

### How they happen

Termination is two halves. The **lifecycle move** is immediate and HTTP — and
since `0068` it also unassigns the seat's work items and cancels its
outstanding appointments *in the same transaction*, because neither referential
action fires when nothing ever deletes an employee row
(`routes::employees::set_lifecycle`). The **release of eleven provider
resources** is asynchronous, via the `employee.terminated` outbox event, and it
is the half this section is about. If a provider is down, the release handler
fails, the outbox retries eight times and dead-letters. Nothing retries after
that — so the provisioning loop's **sweep** asks the database directly, every tick:
*is there a terminated employee still holding a binding?*

The sweep re-runs the release for anything with attempts left, and past the cap
(`5`) it stops calling providers and files an approval instead — actor
`termination-sweeper`, role `operator` — whose reason names the provider, the
external id and what to go and cancel.

### The one thing that is never retried

`release_not_supported`. This is **structural**, not transient. Resend's sending
domain is shared across the tenant, so the adapter refuses to delete it on
purpose and will refuse identically forever. Retrying would burn a provider call
and re-fire an operator alert on every 200ms tick for the life of the
deployment, so those rows are excluded from the retry set — which would make
them invisible if there were not a separate query for them.

The binding **stays on the row**. The external id is the only record of what a
human still has to cancel.

### Finding them

There is an endpoint, and it is the one to use:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  "localhost:8090/v1/inventory/stranded?limit=50" | jq
```

It returns `employee_id`, `employee_slug`, `step`, `provider`, `external_id`,
`state`, `last_error` and `updated_at` — everything a human needs to cancel the
thing by hand. `limit` defaults to 50 and caps at 200. It is scoped by the API
key's tenant like everything else.

`agentos_store::provisioning::stranded` is the library equivalent. In SQL, per
tenant:

```sql
SELECT r.employee_id, r.step, r.provider, r.external_id, r.state, r.last_error
FROM   employee_resources r
JOIN   employees e ON e.id = r.employee_id
WHERE  e.lifecycle = 'terminated'
  AND  r.provider IS NOT NULL
  AND  r.external_id IS NOT NULL
ORDER  BY r.updated_at;
```

This is **the operator's list**: "go and cancel these by hand". It is a list and
not a counter because a number tells nobody what to cancel. (`/metrics` is
mounted and could carry a gauge, but a gauge would still not say what to
cancel — see §9.)

Log lines to alert on:

```
employee terminated but these resources CANNOT be released by their provider
and are still being billed - they need cancelling by hand
gave up releasing these; a human has to cancel them at the provider
```

### Clearing one

1. Cancel it at the provider, by hand, using `provider` + `external_id`.
2. Then, and only then, clear the binding:

```sql
UPDATE employee_resources
   SET state = 'disabled', provider = NULL, external_id = NULL, last_error = NULL,
       updated_at = now()
 WHERE employee_id = '<id>' AND step = '<step>';
```

Clearing the binding first loses the only pointer to the thing you are paying
for. Do not.

### The other kind of stuck: a send nobody got an answer to

A stranded resource is something we are still **paying** for. An *unsettled
send* is the other shape: a request that left this process and never came back
with an answer, so nothing in this system can say whether a person received it.
It is what the write-ahead row in `provider_intents` is written for.

#### Finding them

On the seat, and there is no list of its own — see
`routes::employees::EmployeeView::unsettled_calls`:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" \
  "localhost:8090/v1/employees/$EMPLOYEE_ID" | jq .unsettled_calls
```

```json
[
  {
    "intent_kind": "sms_send",
    "provider": "telephony",
    "idempotency_key": "employee:019905c2-…:step:effect:019905d1-…",
    "started_at": "2026-08-29T04:11:07.881293Z"
  }
]
```

`[]` is the normal case. A request only appears once it has been outstanding for
**five minutes** (`SETTLING`, in `routes::employees`), which is well past the
60-second `REQUEST_TIMEOUT` every adapter builds its HTTP client with.

Every seat at once, per tenant, in SQL:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, intent_kind, provider, idempotency_key, created_at
FROM   provider_intents
WHERE  state = 'in_flight' AND step IS NULL
  AND  created_at < now() - interval '5 minutes'
ORDER  BY created_at;
```

`step IS NULL` is the whole of what separates a send from a provisioning step.
A stuck *step* has the machinery earlier in this section and is not this list.

**Read this list as pessimistic: most rows on it are sends that never
happened.** A row is left open by `ProviderError::Retryable`, and that class is
dominated by requests that never reached the provider at all — a refused
connection, a DNS failure, a 503 from an edge that forwarded nothing — beside
the one member that genuinely is ambiguous, a read timeout after the bytes went
out. Nothing on this side of the socket can tell them apart, so all of them are
reported. **A row means *go and check*. It never means *this went out twice*.**

#### Clearing one

1. **Find out who it was to.** The key ends in the Policy Gate `decision_id`,
   and that is the join:

   ```sql
   SELECT action_kind, payload ->> 'counterparty' AS recipient, occurred_at
   FROM   audit_log
   WHERE  decision_id = '<the uuid after `:effect:` in the key>';
   ```

   The recipient is deliberately not copied onto `provider_intents` — it is
   already written once, under that tenant's RLS, and a second copy is the one
   somebody forgets to redact.

2. **Look for the message at the provider, by recipient and time.** Not by the
   key: for `sms_send` and `whatsapp_send` the key never leaves this process
   (`TwilioTelephony::create` keeps it in a process-local map; the Messages API
   has no field to put it in), so the Twilio console is searched on `To` and the
   `started_at` minute. This step is a human in a browser on purpose — there is
   no API call this system could make instead, which is the entire reason the
   row exists.

3. **Close the row by hand with what you learned.** Nothing re-sends and nothing
   retries; this is bookkeeping, and whether to send the message again is a
   separate decision taken the normal way.

```sql
-- it did go out
UPDATE provider_intents
   SET state = 'succeeded', external_id = '<the provider''s own id>',
       updated_at = now()
 WHERE idempotency_key = '<key>' AND state = 'in_flight';

-- it never left
UPDATE provider_intents
   SET state = 'failed', last_error = 'settled by hand: not at the provider',
       updated_at = now()
 WHERE idempotency_key = '<key>' AND state = 'in_flight';
```

Update, never `DELETE` — the same rule as an abandoned dead letter in §5. The
row is the record that somebody looked.

**Why this is written down at all.** A list that is never emptied stops being
opened, and then the one row that mattered sits in it unread beside four hundred
that did not. Nothing in the system will empty it: no loop reads
`provider_intents` for sends, and there is deliberately no reaper here — a
reaper would have to invent an answer, and inventing one is the failure this
whole path was built to stop.

### The other kind of stuck: an overdue external wait

A step in `pending_external` that never resolves (a rejected Twilio bundle looks
exactly like one still in review, from here) is escalated by the reaper. Find
those in the approvals queue:

```bash
curl -s -H "Authorization: Bearer $KEY" localhost:8090/v1/approvals | jq
```

---

## 7. Approvals

```
GET  /v1/approvals              the queue: pending, oldest first
GET  /v1/approvals/{id}         one item
POST /v1/approvals/{id}/approve redeem it
POST /v1/approvals/{id}/deny    refuse it
```

Two rules an operator has to know:

**`approve` requires the action in its body.** You do not press a button next to
an id — you restate what you are approving, and the gate re-hashes that
restatement against the hash filed when the approval was requested. Approve
"$100 to supplier A" while the body says supplier B and you get
`approval_action_mismatch`. Defaulting the body to the stored action would make
the check a tautology.

**Four eyes, and the role is your API-key label.** The approver must not be the
requester (`requested_by` is compared against your key's label), and must hold
the `required_role` on the approval. There is no roles table in this build: *the
key's label is the role.* A key labelled `approver` can decide approvals that
require `approver`; the loops file theirs requiring `operator`, so you need a
key labelled `operator` to clear a reaper or sweeper escalation.

**Approving performs the effect for `payment_create`, and for nothing else.**
Every other kind mints the capability token, spends the nonce, reports a decision
id and stops — `Authorized<Action>` satisfies no `Effects` bound, so there is
nothing to hand it to. A payment is redeemed into a typed subject and passed to
`Effects::pay`.

What you will see today is **`501 no_payment_rail`** with `state: "pending"`,
because this build has no payment rail (SPEC §13) and the route asks the port
before it redeems. That is the system working, and **the approval is not
spent**: it stays in the queue and the same button works the day an adapter is
bound. Confirm with `GET /v1/approvals/{id}`, which still reads `pending`.
`/readyz` reports the same fact ahead of time as `payment_rail: false`, and
`agentos-server doctor` has a `payments` line saying it in full.

On a deployment that *does* have a rail, the failure to know about is
**`502 payment_not_performed`** with the provider's own word in
`payment_error`. That body carries `state: "redeemed"` and the `decision_id`:
**the approval is spent**, so the 502 is not something to retry — a second
`POST` is `approval_already_decided`. It means money possibly in flight against
a decision already consumed. Read the `provider_intents` row (written *before*
the port is entered) against the rail's own statement, and file a fresh approval
only once you know the money did not move.

The reason it is routed through the façade at all is the ledger, not the money:
redeeming a payment approval *reserves* against the day's bucket, and only
`Effects::pay` settles or releases it. Before this route reached it, an approved
payment held the seat's headroom — and its team's — until UTC midnight for money
that had not moved. Now a refusal releases both. If you see a payment approval
that ends in neither (the request never returned, say), look for an `in_flight`
row on `GET /v1/employees/{id}`'s `unsettled_calls` and see §6.

**Approving the same payment twice pays once.** The approval leaves `pending` in
the transaction the gate commits before the payment is attempted, so a retried
`approve` is `approval_already_decided` and the rail is never approached again.

Approvals expire: 24 hours for gate-filed ones, 7 days for loop escalations.

## 8. The security model in one page

Four mechanisms. Each closes a class of bug that review alone does not.

### `Authorized<A>` — no side effect without the gate

Every side effect goes through `PolicyGate::authorize`, which returns
`Authorized<A>`. The `Effects` façade accepts nothing else. `Authorized` has no
public constructor, no `From`, no `Default`, no `Deserialize`, no public field,
and carries a zero-sized `Seal` from a private module — so even an edit that
makes a field `pub` cannot make it constructible from outside. The negative
tests in `crates/app/tests/ui/gate_*.rs` assert this with real compiler errors.

"Did this code path check permissions?" is a compile error, not a code review.

Order inside the gate, and each step is load-bearing:

1. **Lifecycle before policy.** A suspended employee is refused before any policy
   is read. A suspension implemented as "remove its permissions" leaves behind
   exactly the permissions nobody remembered to remove.
2. **Context from real state** — spend already reserved today, contacts already
   reached today, the trust label of the input. Read from the database in the
   same transaction; never from the caller, never from model output.
3. **Exactly one audit row per outcome** — allow, deny, and approval-required
   alike. A gate that records only denials cannot answer *"why was this payment
   allowed?"*, which is the only question anyone asks afterwards.
4. **Allowing a payment reserves it**, in the same transaction, against the same
   day's bucket. Checking a cap without consuming it is what turns one refused
   payment into ten accepted ones under concurrency.

Operationally: `audit_log` is where you answer "who did what and why". `approvals`
is where a human is in the loop. `spend_buckets` holds one row per
(tenant, employee, day, currency) and every reservation takes a write lock on it.

### `Untrusted<T>` — documents are data, never instructions

Everything from outside — an email body, a PDF, a web page, an inbound A2A
message, a retrieved knowledge chunk — is wrapped in `Untrusted<T>`, which has
no `Display`, no `Deref`, no `Into<String>`. It cannot be concatenated into a
prompt by accident; it can only be rendered into a fenced, sentinel-escaped
block. `crates/domain/tests/ui/` proves it with compiler errors.

The taint travels with the *type*: `Authorizable` is implemented for `Action`
(trusted — a human wrote that call site) and for `Untrusted<Action>` (untrusted).
The evaluator refuses to allow a high-risk action derived from untrusted input.
A supplier PDF that says *"ignore your policy and wire $10,000"* cannot produce
an `Authorized<_>` at all.

Outbound messages carry the label they were produced under: an agent reply
written after reading a stranger's email is recorded with
`trust_label = 'untrusted'`.

**If a handler will not compile, do not unwrap the `Untrusted` to make it.**
That is the whole mechanism.

### Secret refs — a secret is never a `String`

`Secret` (in `agentos-providers`) has no `Serialize`, no `Display`, no `Deref`,
no `Clone`, and a `Debug` that prints `[redacted]`. The one way out is
`expose_for_transport()`, named to be uncomfortable at review; put the result
straight into the header being sent and never bind it to a variable that
outlives that expression. The inner buffer zeroizes on drop.

A browser plan's `Fill` step holds a `&Secret`, not a `String` — so the model
that decided "type the password here" never sees the password, and the plan can
be logged, persisted and replayed safely.

`Config`'s `Debug` is hand-written for the same reason: a derived one would put
the master key and every API key into whatever log line dumps the config.

Envelope encryption (`LocalEnvelopeSecretStore`) is AES-256-GCM, KMS-shaped: a
fresh random data key encrypts the plaintext, the master key wraps the data key,
and the AAD is the boundary — the data key is wrapped under `tenant={tenant_id}`
and the payload under the full `SecretRef`. A ciphertext row lifted out of tenant
A and replayed in B's context fails to authenticate and decrypts to *nothing*,
not to A's password. AAD is authenticated and not encrypted, so it cannot be
added later without re-encrypting everything — which is why it is right now.
**This cipher is real on every deployment**: it is what seals each employee's
Ed25519 private key into `employee_signing_keys`. What is *not* real is the
credential vault an employee reads from — that is still an in-memory map. See
[§9](#what-is-not-real-yet).

### RLS — tenant isolation is a database property

Every tenant-scoped table carries `tenant_id`, has RLS enabled **and FORCE ROW
LEVEL SECURITY**, with a policy keyed on `current_setting('app.tenant_id', true)`.

`Db::tenant_tx` issues two statements before you see the transaction:

1. `SET LOCAL ROLE app_role` — **without this the whole scheme is decorative.**
   RLS does not apply to superusers, to `BYPASSRLS` roles, or (without FORCE) to
   the table owner, and deployments routinely connect as `postgres`.
2. `set_config('app.tenant_id', $1, true)` — transaction-local, bound parameter,
   not concatenated SQL.

Both unwind with the transaction, so a pooled connection is never handed back
still wearing a tenant's identity. `Db` does not expose its pool: there is no
accessor, no `Deref`, no `pub(crate)` leak. The only public way to a connection
is `tenant_tx`.

The escape hatch is `Db::admin_tx_bypassing_rls`, named so it cannot appear in a
diff unnoticed. This paragraph used to read "three legitimate callers:
migrations, the outbox poller and the provisioning loop's claims", and it was
wrong twice. There are **many more outside tests** — and *migrations was never
one of them*: `Db::migrate` runs sqlx's migrator against the pool and opens no
transaction at all.

The list was replaced by a measured count — 26 production calls against 273 in
tests, a split that needed hand-checking because four files carry a
`#[cfg(test)]` that does not open a test module — and then the number was
dropped too. Not because anybody miscounted, but because the count was correct
on the day it was taken and is a hostage to the next commit. The shape below is
what does not go stale.

What is legitimate is a **shape**, not a list, which is why the list kept going
stale while the shape never did:

- a loop that is cross-tenant by definition — outbox, inbound, initiative,
  provisioning, the MCP rebinder, `/metrics`. The queue is nobody's.
- a read of a row that belongs to no tenant — the platform policy ceiling,
  whose `tenant_id` is `NULL`.
- a lookup that runs *before* anybody knows who is asking, and whose whole job
  is to answer that: `api_keys::lookup` given a bearer token,
  `webhooks::lookup` given a delivery path, `routes::a2a::discover` given an
  unauthenticated peer. All three open `SET TRANSACTION READ ONLY` or hand
  their answer straight to a `tenant_tx`, so the widest thing they can do is
  read one row and narrow.
- the platform operator surface, `routes/platform.rs`, which crosses tenants on
  purpose and is authenticated by a *different keyring* — `PlatformPrincipal`
  is a distinct Rust type from `auth::Principal`, and no handler accepts both.

`grep -rn admin_tx_bypassing_rls` is the list. A number in a document is not,
and the number that was here read as reassurance while being off by an order of
magnitude.

**`tenant_id` comes from the API key and from nothing else.** `Principal` is
built in exactly one place, from the `Authorization` header, and is not
`Deserialize`, so it cannot arrive in a body. An id belonging to another tenant
is invisible to RLS, surfaces as `NotFound`, and is answered **404** — not 403,
which would confirm the id exists. Webhook deliveries take their tenant from the
`AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` registration or from the `webhook_endpoints` row,
never off the wire.

`webhook_endpoints` is the fourth caller of the escape hatch, and it is the one
that is *unauthenticated*: `agentos_store::webhooks::lookup` runs before anybody
knows who is asking, so it opens the transaction `READ ONLY`, its SQL is a
`&'static str`, it projects three columns, and it returns ciphertext — the row
only becomes a usable secret inside `agentos_app::webhooks`, under AAD
`webhook://<tenant>`, so a blob lifted into another tenant's row opens as
nothing. Same shape and same four defences as `agentos_store::api_keys::lookup`.

**Deploying with a non-superuser login role:** that role must be a member of
`app_role` (`GRANT app_role TO app_login`) or `SET LOCAL ROLE` fails and every
request errors. `app_role` is `NOLOGIN` by design — it is a hat the connection
puts on, not an account. The role that runs migrations still needs `CREATE ROLE`
and DDL rights.

### The middleware stack, and why the order is the order

```
request-id → trace → body limit → timeout → auth → rate limit → idempotency
```

* **request-id first**, so every log line below carries the same id.
* **body limit before timeout**, so a 10 GB upload is refused on the first chunk
  rather than read for thirty seconds and then refused. Cap is 1 MiB
  (256 KiB for webhooks).
* **auth before rate limit**, because the limit is per tenant and there is no
  tenant until the key is checked. The other order lets an unauthenticated
  caller burn a tenant's budget.
* **idempotency last (innermost)**, so a replay is answered after authentication.
  Above auth it would let anyone read back another tenant's stored response.

Rate limit: **600 requests per tenant per 60s**, fixed window, in memory, per
replica. Two known ceilings, both currently acceptable: a tenant can send 2× the
limit across a window boundary, and the budget is per replica rather than per
cluster.

Five routes sit outside the API stack: `/livez`, `/readyz`,
`POST /v1/webhooks/{provider}`, `GET /.well-known/agent-card.json` and
`GET /.well-known/http-message-signatures-directory`. A provider has a
signature, not an API key, and a peer fetching your public key has neither. They
are therefore outside the rate limiter too, which is keyed on a tenant it cannot
know — a per-source limit belongs at your ingress proxy, which is also the only
thing that can see the real client address. What protects them is the 1 MiB body
cap (256 KiB for webhooks) and the 30s timeout.

Note that `POST /a2a/jsonrpc` is **inside** the stack: an A2A peer needs an
`AGENTOS_API_KEYS` entry whose *label* is its domain. The RFC 9421 signature is
an additive check on top of that — unsigned requests are accepted, wrongly
signed ones are refused, and an unreachable key directory is a downgrade.

---

## 9. What is not real yet

Read this before you trust anything above it. The repository's own commits are
candid about these; the docs match.

**The provider adapters are real when their credential is set**, and the mock
when it is not — per adapter, decided in `config.rs` and built in
`mocks::adapters_for` / `mocks::ports_for`. What a fully credentialed
deployment still does *not* do is listed below; see `docs/PROVIDERS.md` for the
per-vendor detail.

**The embedder is a SHA-256 hash unless `EMBEDDER_API_KEY` is set.** Without it,
retrieval runs on word matching alone — the vector leg is not consulted at all,
because a hash has no opinion about meaning and five confident unrelated
passages are worse than none. "cat" and "kitten" are as unrelated as "cat" and
"diesel". With it, `OpenAiEmbedder` embeds against the customer's key and
retrieval is hybrid again; documents ingested before the switch keep their old
model and have to be ingested again.

**The employee secret vault is an in-process plaintext map** that forgets on
restart. The envelope cipher that seals employee signing keys is real and is a
different thing.

**WhatsApp has no adapter at all**, so the `whatsapp` step fails
`no_whatsapp_sender` on every deployment and `degraded` is the healthy steady
state for an otherwise online employee.

**Inbound telephony is wired end to end, and one provider setting is what still
stops it.** `/v1/webhooks/{provider}` speaks *two* schemes and the endpoint's
`provider` picks — `twilio` gets Twilio's HMAC-SHA1-over-the-callback-URL,
anything else gets Svix (`migrations/0069` widened the CHECK that used to refuse
the value). The reader is `main::on_telephony_webhook` →
`inbound::land_inbound_text`: routing, thread, message and the agent turn all
commit together. What is missing is one line at the *other* end:
`TwilioTelephony::ensure_number` posts `PhoneNumber` and `FriendlyName` and **no
`SmsUrl`**, so a number this build bought is a number Twilio was never told
where to deliver for. Nothing arrives — not because the ingest is absent, but
because the number points nowhere. The phone entry further down this section
says the same thing from the purchase's side.

**The Policy Gate reads its limits from Postgres, and an empty database grants
nothing.** The gate loads `policy_layers` per decision, so a cap an operator
changes takes effect on the next action rather than the next deploy — and a
deployment with no platform ceiling denies **every** agent-initiated side effect
until one is installed ([§1.5](#15-the-policy-ceiling-you-have-to-install)).
`agentos-server policy install` is the only writer of a platform layer outside a
test fixture.

**The three layers under the ceiling have a writer too**: `policy install
--tenant`, with `--role` or `--employee` to go a layer deeper — §1.4b above is
the worked example, and this paragraph said there was none long after it landed.
A tenant with no layer of its own still runs on the ceiling itself, because an
absent layer inherits the one above it, and that part has not changed.

**`AGENTOS_MASTER_KEY` is load-bearing, and this is the second exception.**
`mocks::adapters(master_key)` threads it into a real `LocalEnvelopeSecretStore`
used as a **cipher**: `Step::Identity` mints a real Ed25519 keypair and seals its
private half into `employee_signing_keys.sealed_private_key`. A mock provider
that invents a phone number costs nothing; a mock cipher costs an identity.
**Lose the master key and every employee's signing key is unrecoverable.** Back
it up (§10).

The *vault* — the `SecretStore` an employee reads credentials out of — is still
`MemorySecretStore`, a plaintext in-process map that forgets on restart. On a
mock deployment it holds a provisioning canary and nothing else. The envelope
store's own backing map is in-process too; only the signing key is durable, and
it is durable because it lives in a table rather than in the store.

**MCP and payments refuse rather than pretend.** Both ports return
`Terminal { code: "not_configured" }` and log it. That is deliberate: a fake
that returns a plausible payment id is a fake that will one day be believed.
The payment port is now genuinely *reached* — from a turn's `pay` tool and from
`POST /v1/approvals/{id}/approve` — so that refusal is what an operator sees as
a `502`, and every attempt leaves a settled `provider_intents` row. Nothing is
missing but the rail, and which rail is SPEC §13's open decision.

**WhatsApp never provisions.** `Step::Whatsapp` needs
`EngineConfig::whatsapp_sender`, `EngineConfig::default()` sets it to `None`, and
`main.rs` uses the default — so the step always fails `no_whatsapp_sender`. It is
non-blocking, so the employee still reaches `active`, but its `health` never
reaches `online`; `degraded` is the healthy steady state on this build.

**No phone number is bought at all.** `EngineConfig::default()` sets
`provision_phone: false`, so `Step::Phone` settles as `StepReport::NotWired` and
the resource row lands in `disabled` with the reason on it — no provider call, no
external id, no monthly invoice. It used to buy one per employee.

**Nothing in this build can *send* on a number**: no `sms_send` or `call_place`
row in `turn::catalogue`, both listed in `turn::UNSERVED`, and the platform
ceiling grants neither `sms` nor `voice`, which layers can only narrow. Three
independent reasons, any one of them enough.

**Receiving is a different sentence now, and it has exactly one hole.** The
ingest exists — `/v1/webhooks/{provider}` verifies Twilio's own scheme,
`main::on_telephony_webhook` reads the row and `inbound::land_telephony_callback`
lands it — a text through `land_inbound_text`, which wakes the employee; a
placed call's status callback through `land_call_outcome`, which does not. The hole is at the purchase:
`TwilioTelephony::ensure_number` sets **no `SmsUrl`** on the number it buys, so
Twilio has no address to POST to and the verified door is never knocked on. That
is one form field in one POST, and it is not set because setting it points a
live carrier at this deployment — a decision with a bill and a public origin
behind it, not a default.

`disabled` does not degrade an optional channel, so this costs no health. The
switch is Rust and reachable from no environment variable on purpose: turning it
on starts a recurring bill, which is a code change and a deploy rather than an
export. `the_shipped_default_matches_what_this_build_can_actually_use` pins it to
the catalogue in both directions, so it cannot drift from what the binary can do.

**Numbers bought before this are left exactly where they are.** A `ready` phone
row keeps its state, its provider and its external id: the number is real, it is
still billed, and that id is the only thing that says what to cancel. Nothing
releases it automatically. They surface through
`GET /v1/inventory/stranded` — but only once the employee is terminated, which is
what that endpoint asks about. **A number held by an employee who is still active
has no endpoint**; today it is a SQL question:

```sql
select employee_id, external_id, provider, state
  from employee_resources where step = 'phone' and external_id is not null;
```

**Phone numbers, if ever bought again, are bought in `US`.**
`EngineConfig::default()` hard-codes `Region::new("US")` and nothing overrides it.

**Two webhook signature schemes, and the endpoint's `provider` picks.**
`twilio` gets Twilio's HMAC-SHA1 over the callback URL plus sorted form
parameters; every other provider gets Standard Webhooks / Svix. There is no
`scheme` field to set — it is a function of `provider`, deliberately, so the two
cannot disagree. An endpoint registered under the wrong provider has its genuine
deliveries answered **401**, which is visible; neither direction skips a check.

The telephony arm needs one thing the other does not: **`PUBLIC_HOST` must be
exactly the origin you pasted into the Twilio console**, because that scheme MACs
the callback URL itself. A deployment whose idea of its own address differs by
one character answers 401 to every genuine text. That is why a telephony
verification failure logs the URL it signed over — it is our own configured
string, not a secret, and it turns "everything 401s" into one line.

**One webhook endpoint per provider per deployment *in the environment*.**
`AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` is a `HashMap` keyed on the path segment, so it holds
one registration per provider for the whole deployment and a second entry on one
path is a boot failure. That is no longer the ceiling it used to be: the
`webhook_endpoints` table (`migrations/0053`, `POST /v1/platform/webhooks`) is
where a second tenant behind the same provider account is registered, on an
opaque minted path. §470's table entry has said so for some time while this
sentence went on calling the table hypothetical.

**API keys are issued and revoked at runtime, without a restart.**
`POST /v1/platform/keys` issues one and `DELETE /v1/platform/keys/{id}` revokes
it; `auth::Keyring` reads the environment first and then `api_keys`, on every
authenticated request with no cache, which is what makes revocation instant
rather than eventually-consistent. The environment keyring still exists and
still works — unset authenticates nobody — and neither half stores a secret, only
its hash. This entry used to read "cannot be issued or revoked without a
restart", which was true of the environment half alone.

**No dead-letter endpoint.** That is SQL. There *is* a stranded-resource
endpoint (§6) and a knowledge *ingest* endpoint
(`POST /v1/knowledge/documents`) — but no knowledge *search* endpoint; retrieval
happens inside a turn. There is also a tenant endpoint, `POST /v1/platform/tenants`,
behind `AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEYS` — this entry named it as missing alongside the
others. What has no route, and cannot have one, is a tenant creating a tenant:
every route on the tenant surface derives its tenant from the API key.

**`/metrics` is mounted, and it is behind `AGENTOS_METRICS_KEY`.**
`apps/server/src/metrics.rs` builds a Prometheus router with six families and
`app()` merges it beside `/livez` and `/readyz`, outside the API auth stack —
a scraper holds no tenant credential, and every number it exposes is a
cross-tenant aggregate, so neither the tenant keyring nor
`AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEYS` is the right credential for it. What it takes instead is
one bare secret of at least 32 characters, presented as `Authorization: Bearer
…`; put the same value in the scrape job's `bearer_token`. **Unset means 401 for
everybody, Prometheus included** — the flat dashboard is the intended symptom,
and the boot log warns about it once.

This entry read "unauthenticated by design" until the door was fitted, with the
ingress named as the only control. That was a requirement in a runbook rather
than something the process enforced, and on a deployment whose ingress publishes
four paths — none of them this one — while the API also answers on the container
network, the page was reachable by anything on that network. It tells a stranger
the deny-reason mix and the depth of the approval queue: what the company tried
to do, and what it was refused.

`/livez` and `/readyz` stay open on purpose. A probe that authenticates reports
the process dead whenever the credential is wrong, which inverts what a probe is
for, and between them they publish a boolean, the mock adapter list and the
outbox lag. Restricting all three to the scrape network at the ingress is still
worth doing — it is no longer the only thing in front of the interesting one.

All six carry live numbers. `agentos_llm_tokens_total` was the last to:
`metrics::record_llm_usage` is called from `main.rs`'s turn handler on both its
exits, the failed turn and the finished one. This paragraph, `README.md` and
`SPEC.md` §27 all said it had no production caller — one sentence, three
documents, and fixing any one of them alone would have read like a correction
while two copies went on lying. The complementary operational reads remain
`/readyz`, `/v1/inventory/stranded` and SQL.

**Company knowledge is plaintext and Markdown only.** No URL fetching, no PDF
parsing, no file upload, no malware or content-type validation. Retrieval
quality now depends on whether `EMBEDDER_API_KEY` is set: without it the
embedder is a SHA-256 hash with no semantics and retrieval is word matching,
which on an inbound email almost never matches.

**No payments, no WhatsApp adapter, and a voice half.** The payment port
refuses with `not_configured`; `Step::Whatsapp` fails `no_whatsapp_sender` on
every deployment, which is why `degraded` is the healthy steady state.

`Channel::Voice` is no longer a policy channel with *nothing* behind it, and it
is still not a phone call anybody can hold a conversation on.
`TelephonyProvider::place_call` dials — mock and Twilio, both held to the shared
contract suite — and the callee now hears one sentence: `OutboundCall::says`
renders as `<Say>`, which is **Twilio's** speech synthesis on the tenant's own
account, so no model or key of ours is spent and no audio crosses this process.
What became of the call comes back too: `StatusCallback` is posted to the
telephony webhook endpoint this deployment already receives texts on, and
`inbound::land_call_outcome` writes a `call_completed` audit row under the
employee whose `provider_intents` row named the sid.

Recognition and a turn-taking loop still exist nowhere in this tree, so the call
broadcasts and hangs up. And none of it is reachable: no employee can propose it
(`call_place` is not in `turn::catalogue`, and `turn::UNSERVED` says why) and no
tenant could authorise it if one could (`default_ceiling` grants neither `voice`
nor a calling code, and layers only narrow). A successful `place_call` still
means a carrier agreed to dial and never that anybody picked up — the difference
is that the second row now says which.

**Two operational notes if you ever do configure voice.** The status callback
address is derived at boot from `PUBLIC_HOST` and names the *environment*
registry's path (`/v1/webhooks/twilio`), so a deployment whose telephony
endpoint is a stored `webhook_endpoints` row on a minted `whe_…` path will see
its callbacks answered **404** — the calls still happen, the outcomes are lost,
and the symptom is `webhook for an unregistered path` in the log. And a callback
whose `CallSid` matches no `provider_intents` row is `unknown_call`, dead-
lettered on the first attempt: that is another application on the same Twilio
account, or a send whose accept-response never reached us (in which case the row
is in `unsettled_calls` and no callback can ever join to it).

**No key rotation.** One signing key per employee is the primary key of the
table and `UPDATE` is revoked, so rotation is delete-then-insert with no overlap
window. Revocation is by lifecycle: the key directory joins `lifecycle =
'active'`, so suspending an employee un-publishes its key.

**The mock email inbox is process-local.** An inbound notice recorded by the
webhook route can only be fetched back by *this* process's mock. That is a
property of running on fakes, not a bug to design around — but it means a
restart loses in-flight mock mail.

---

## 10. Backup and restore

The whole durable state of this system is the Postgres database. There is no
store beside it: no queue, no cache, and the file store (`files`, `0067`) is a
`bytea` column in that same database rather than a bucket somewhere else.
Inbound attachments used to be the exception — they went to an in-process
`HashMap` that no restart survived and no reader could reach — and they are not
any more: `ingest_email` deposits them into `files`, so they are in the dump
like everything else. Back up Postgres and you have backed up AgentOS.

### The important thing to understand first

A restore rewinds the outbox. Events already published stay published
(`published_at` is in the dump), but anything that was in flight comes back
claimable — so **a restore replays side effects** on an at-least-once system. If
you restore a database that was live within the last few hours, expect some
emails to go out twice. Stop the server, restore, and read the outbox before
starting it again:

```sql
SELECT event_type, count(*) FROM outbox_events
WHERE published_at IS NULL GROUP BY 1;
```

### Logical backup (preferred — portable, and what you want for a restore test)

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres \
  pg_dump -U postgres -d agentos --format=custom --no-owner \
  > agentos-$(date +%F-%H%M).dump
```

Restore into a fresh database:

```bash
docker compose exec -T postgres createdb -U postgres agentos_restore
docker compose exec -T postgres \
  pg_restore -U postgres -d agentos_restore --no-owner < agentos-2026-01-01-0900.dump
```

`--no-owner` matters: `app_role` is cluster-wide and already exists on the
target. If it does not (a brand-new cluster), create it before restoring, or run
`0001_core.sql` first — it creates the role idempotently.

To restore over the live database, drop and recreate it rather than restoring
into a populated one:

```bash
docker compose stop        # nothing must be connected
docker compose start postgres
docker compose exec -T postgres dropdb   -U postgres agentos
docker compose exec -T postgres createdb -U postgres agentos
docker compose exec -T postgres pg_restore -U postgres -d agentos --no-owner < backup.dump
```

### Volume backup (faster, cluster-wide, not portable across PG versions)

The named volume is `pgdata`, mounted at `/var/lib/postgresql`.

```bash
docker compose stop postgres          # a hot copy of a running datadir is not a backup
docker run --rm -v <project>_pgdata:/data -v "$PWD":/out alpine \
  tar czf /out/pgdata-$(date +%F).tgz -C /data .
docker compose start postgres
```

Restore:

```bash
docker compose down
docker volume rm <project>_pgdata
docker volume create <project>_pgdata
docker run --rm -v <project>_pgdata:/data -v "$PWD":/in alpine \
  tar xzf /in/pgdata-2026-01-01.tgz -C /data
docker compose up -d
```

`docker volume ls` gives you the real prefixed name. **Stop the container
first** — copying a running data directory produces a file set Postgres may
refuse to start on, and you will not find out until the restore.

### After any restore

1. Start the server. Migrations re-run and are no-ops if the dump was current;
   if the dump predates a migration, it applies then.
2. `curl /readyz` — a large `outbox_lag_secs` right after a restore is expected
   and should fall.
3. Check dead letters ([§5](#5-dead-letters)) — anything that was mid-retry when
   the dump was taken comes back with its attempt count intact.
4. Check stranded resources ([§6](#6-stranded-resources)) — a restore can revive
   a terminated employee's bindings for resources you already cancelled by hand.
   Those rows will be swept, the release will 404, and a 404 from a delete is
   treated as success. That is the intended behaviour and it is safe.

### What a backup does not cover

`AGENTOS_MASTER_KEY`, `AGENTOS_API_KEYS` and `AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` are
process configuration, not database rows. Back them up wherever you keep
deployment secrets.

**Back up the master key with the same care as the database, and restore them
together.** `employee_signing_keys.sealed_private_key` is encrypted under it on
every deployment, mock or not. A dump restored without the matching master key
gives you every employee's *public* key and no way to sign with any of them —
and because `UPDATE` on that table is revoked and there is no rotation path,
recovery means deleting the rows and re-provisioning identity, which changes
every published `kid`.
