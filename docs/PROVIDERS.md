# Providers

What each external account is for, which credential to copy where, and which
capabilities are gated on a **human** at the other end — the ones no amount of
code shortens.

---

## Read this first

**The credential selects the adapter.** `apps/server/src/main.rs` builds its
adapters with `mocks::adapters_for(&config.master_key, &config.credentials)` and
`mocks::ports_for(&config.credentials)`. A credential that is present builds the
real client; absent builds the mock beside it, and the boot guard refuses a mock
nobody accepted, naming which one.

Selection is **per adapter**. A deployment with a Resend key and no Twilio
account runs real email and a fake phone. That is the normal state of an
integration, not an error.

| Provider | Adapter | Credential | Shape |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Anthropic** | `llm_anthropic.rs` | `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `AGENTOS_LLM=anthropic` | — |
| local `claude` CLI | `llm_cli.rs` | none — `AGENTOS_LLM=cli` | — |
| **Resend** | `email_resend.rs` | `EMAIL_API_KEY` | `re_…` |
| **Twilio** | `telephony_twilio.rs` | `TELEPHONY_API_KEY` | `ACxxxx:auth_token` |
| **Browserbase** | `browser_browserbase.rs` + `cdp.rs` | `BROWSER_API_KEY` | `project-id:api-key` |
| **OpenAI embeddings** | `embedder_openai.rs` | `EMBEDDER_API_KEY` | `sk-…` |
| Meta WhatsApp | none at all | — | — |
| secret vault | mock only — an in-process plaintext map | — | — |
| MCP | none — refuses | — | — |
| payments | none — refuses | — | — |

Two of the four are compound because the adapter behind them takes two values,
and they are one variable each for the same reason the keyring is. **Half of one
is a named boot failure** — an adapter holding half a credential is the
deployment that believes it is sending mail and is not. `EMBEDDER_API_KEY` is
single because the adapter takes one value: the customer's key. The model is a
constant, not a second half.

The email adapter's third input, the `whsec_…` signing secret, comes from the
`email` entry of `AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS`, where you have already pasted it.
Its sending domain is `AGENT_EMAIL_DOMAIN`. Neither has a variable of its own.

That variable holds **one tenant per provider** and always has. A deployment
with a second customer registers theirs in `webhook_endpoints` instead — see
"More than one customer on one provider account" below — and the *outbound*
adapter still takes its signing secret from here, because the adapter is one per
deployment.

`EMBEDDER_API_KEY` is read again, and the argument that deleted it is answered
rather than dropped. It used to satisfy the boot guard while *selecting
nothing*, because `Embedder` had one variant and it was a hash — a credential
that cannot change what runs must not be able to quiet an alarm. It changes what
runs now: it builds `OpenAiEmbedder`, `Embedder::is_semantic()` becomes `true`,
and `knowledge::retrieve` runs the vector leg it refuses to run on a hash. One
value and not a pair, because the customer brings the key and the **model name
is ours** — see "The embedder" below.

Two things are real whatever the credentials say. The **envelope cipher**:
`AGENTOS_MASTER_KEY` is threaded into a real `LocalEnvelopeSecretStore`, because
`Step::Identity` mints a real Ed25519 keypair and seals its private half into a
database column — a mock provider that invents a phone number costs nothing, a
mock cipher costs an identity. And the **model**, chosen by `AGENTOS_LLM`.

One is permanently fake, and it is named on every boot so a line with no `MOCK`
in it cannot be manufactured by omission: the **employee secret vault**, which is
a plaintext in-process map that forgets on restart (not the envelope cipher —
that one is real). The embedder used to be the other and is a credential now.

Every boot logs one line naming what is behind every port, and `/readyz` carries
the same inventory as `mock_adapters` for as long as the replica is up:

```
adapters: email=resend telephony=MOCK browser=browserbase embedder=openai \
          llm=anthropic secrets=MOCK(in-memory)
```

Adding a new provider is a change to `crates/app/src/mocks.rs`, plus a row in
`PROVIDER_CREDENTIALS` in `config.rs`. Forgetting the second is a compile error,
not a provider that ships as a mock.

What is enforced is the *crate* boundary, not the file: `apps/server` has no
`agentos-providers` in its manifest, so the binary cannot name a concrete
provider type at all, and that absence is what makes the capability token
unforgeable. This paragraph used to say `mocks.rs` was the only file that may
name one, and there is a second: `crates/app/src/model_access.rs` builds an
`AnthropicLlm` per turn, around **the tenant's own stored key**. That is
precisely the thing `mocks.rs` cannot do — it selects adapters from process
configuration, and a customer's credential is a row, not configuration — so it
is a second site by construction rather than by drift.

## Anthropic — the model the employee reasons with

**What it is for.** Every inbound message becomes an agent turn: the model reads the message, may ask for
tools, and writes the reply that is recorded on the conversation.

**Status: real, wired, in use.**

### The account and the credential

1. Open an account at [console.anthropic.com](https://console.anthropic.com).
2. **Settings → API keys → Create key.** Copy the `sk-ant-…` value; it is shown
   once.
3. Put it in the deployment's environment:

```bash
export AGENTOS_LLM=anthropic
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...
```

Both, together. `AGENTOS_LLM=anthropic` **without** the key is a named boot
failure — deliberately, because the alternative is an employee that accepts mail
for a week and answers none of it. `AGENTOS_LLM` with any other spelling
(`claude`, `openai`, a typo) is also a boot failure listing the valid values; it
never falls back to the mock.

### What it does

`POST https://api.anthropic.com/v1/messages`, `anthropic-version: 2023-06-01`,
120s per-request timeout. Model: `claude-opus-5` (`DEFAULT_MODEL`), hard-coded —
there is nowhere yet for an operator to record a different one.

Three behaviours worth knowing operationally:

* `cache_read_input_tokens` is carried through into the budget counter. It is
  what makes prompt caching visible in cost enforcement.
* `stop_reason == "refusal"` arrives as a **200** with a possibly-empty content
  array. It is a refusal, not an error.
* A timeout is **never** classified terminal — a timed-out request may still have
  landed, so the only safe classification is retryable, and the turn comes back
  on the outbox's backoff.

Not sent, on purpose: `temperature` / `top_p` / `top_k` and
`thinking.budget_tokens` (all removed on `claude-opus-5`; sending them 400s), and
any assistant-turn prefill.

### The zero-credential alternative

```bash
export AGENTOS_LLM=cli
```

Shells out to the `claude` binary on your `PATH`, using the login you already
have. Real inference, no API key — the whole point of it. It still counts as a
mock adapter for the boot guard (`AGENTOS_ALLOW_MOCKS=1` required), because it
runs on somebody's laptop login and should not be a production path.

It is lossier in ways that matter:

* **Tool calls are a shim.** The CLI exposes no structured `tool_use` blocks, so
  the adapter renders the schemas into the prompt and demands strict JSON back.
  A model that answers with prose gets you `cli_not_json`, not a tool call.
* **Caching is not ours.** `cache_breakpoint` is ignored; the reported
  `cache_read_tokens` is dominated by the CLI's own system prompt, so cost
  numbers from this backend do not resemble production ones.
* **One turn, no history reuse.** Every call is a fresh `claude -p`.

The **conversation** goes in on stdin, never argv — it is attacker-influenced
text, and an argument starting with `--` is a flag. The **system prompt** goes
on argv as `--system-prompt`, which is the only way for it to be the model's
system prompt rather than a user message; that is safe because a system prompt
is assembled from the operator's own documents and a counterparty's words never
reach it.

`AGENTOS_LLM=cli` does not put an employee in front of a model — it puts one
inside a Claude Code session. Four arguments and one environment variable are
what stop that session from being the operator's, each of them measured against
`claude` 2.1.231 by dropping it and re-running:

| argument | drop it and the session gets back |
|---|---|
| `--system-prompt <system>` | Claude Code's own identity, ahead of ours |
| `--tools ""` | 30 built-in tools — file and shell access on the host |
| `--strict-mcp-config` | 5 MCP servers out of `~/.claude.json` |
| `--setting-sources ""` | `permissionMode: plan` and the operator's settings |
| `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_AUTO_MEMORY=1` | the operator's private notes, quoted back |

`--allowed-tools ""` used to stand in for all of this and never worked: it is an
auto-approve list, not a registration list, and it left 122 tools live. About
150 tokens of CLI context still get through — the operator's email address and
today's date. See `crates/providers/src/llm_cli.rs` for the measurements.

### Default if you configure nothing

`AGENTOS_LLM` unset means `mock`: a scripted model that answers every message
with a string that says out loud it is a mock and that no judgement is behind
it. That wording is on purpose — a mock model that writes a plausible customer
reply is a mock that ends up in a demo and then in a thread with a real supplier.

---

## Resend — email identity, sending, and inbound

**What it is for.** The employee's mailbox: the sending domain (provisioning
step `email`), outbound mail, and inbound mail via webhook.

**Status: real, and selected by `EMAIL_API_KEY`.** With it set the `email` step
provisions against Resend; without it, against `MockEmailProvider`, which the
boot guard refuses unless `AGENTOS_ALLOW_MOCKS=1`.

### The account and the credentials — *two* of them

1. Open an account at [resend.com](https://resend.com).
2. **Domains → Add domain.** Enter the same value you set as
   `AGENT_EMAIL_DOMAIN`. Resend gives you DNS records (SPF, DKIM, and a
   `MX`/return-path record). Add them at your DNS host and wait for Resend to
   show the domain as verified. *This is DNS propagation, not human review — it
   is usually minutes, occasionally hours.*
3. **API Keys → Create API Key**, sending permission. Copy the `re_…` value.
   This is the API key: `ResendEmailProvider::new(api_key, …)`.
4. **Webhooks → Add endpoint**, pointing at
   `{PUBLIC_HOST}/v1/webhooks/email`, subscribed to `email.received` (and
   whatever delivery events you want). Copy the **signing secret**, a separate
   `whsec_…` value. This is *not* the API key.

Where each goes:

| Credential | Goes into | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `re_…` API key | `EMAIL_API_KEY` | **builds the adapter** — set it and mail is really sent |
| `whsec_…` signing secret | `AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` as `email:<tenant-uuid>:whsec_…`, or `POST /v1/platform/webhooks` for a second customer | verifies inbound deliveries, **and** (from the variable) is handed to the adapter as its own webhook secret — one paste, not two |
| the sending domain | `AGENT_EMAIL_DOMAIN` | the one domain this adapter owns |

The webhook half works even with the mock adapter: the route verifies the
signature against the configured secret and stores the raw bytes. The path
segment (`email`) is the `{path}` in `/v1/webhooks/{path}` and must match the
label in `AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS`. An unregistered path is a **404**, and an
empty registry with an empty `webhook_endpoints` table means no inbound message
can arrive at all.

### More than one customer on one provider account

`AGENTOS_WEBHOOK_SECRETS` is keyed on the path segment, so it holds one endpoint
per path for the whole deployment — two entries on `email` is a boot failure, not
two customers. The second customer onwards gets a row instead:

```bash
curl -sS -X POST http://localhost:8090/v1/platform/webhooks \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $AGENTOS_PLATFORM_KEY" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"tenant_id":"<tenant-uuid>","secret":"whsec_…"}'
# -> 201 {"path":"whe_…","route":"/v1/webhooks/whe_…","rotated":false}
```

Then paste `https://<your-host>/v1/webhooks/whe_…` into **that customer's own
webhook** in the provider's dashboard. The path is opaque on purpose: two
customers behind one Resend account share a signing secret, so the signature
cannot tell them apart and the address is the only thing that can — a
`/{tenant}/{provider}` URL would be derivable from a uuid either customer can
already see. It is still not a credential; the signature is checked either way.

**What this needs from the provider.** Resend delivers a webhook to every
endpoint configured on the account, so two endpoints on one account means both
customers receive both events — a per-customer endpoint only separates the
*queues* if the provider can scope deliveries. In practice that means one Resend
account (or one Resend *domain* with its own webhook) per customer, and the
endpoint URL is what you paste into each. When two customers really do share one
account and one inbox domain, nothing at this layer can separate their mail,
because the provider is not separating it either.

**Rotating.** Post the same call again with the new `whsec_…`: the response is
`200` with `"rotated":true` and **the same path**, so the URL at the provider
does not move and the old secret stops verifying at the moment the row commits.
There is no `DELETE`; to retire an endpoint entirely, remove the row with `psql`.

### Four Resend facts encoded in the adapter

**Inbound is two-phase, and the second phase is on a clock.** `email.received`
carries **metadata only** — an id, envelope addresses, attachment *descriptors*.
No subject, no body, no bytes. The inbound loop retrieves the message, then
follows each descriptor's `download_url`, which Resend expires after **one hour**.
Fetch bytes immediately after the body, never lazily at render time. This is why
the inbound loop is a separate poller with a small batch.

**On a received event `from` is the bare address.** The display name is only in
the headers on the retrieve endpoint, so the adapter prefers the `From` header
over the top-level field.

**Suppression is ACCOUNT-scoped.** One list per account — not per tenant, not per
sending domain. Suppressing `ap@supplier.example` for one tenant would silently
stop every other tenant's employees mailing them. Per-tenant suppression has to
be **our own table**, checked before `send`. The provider does not give it to us
and no caller should assume it does.

That table is `suppressions` (`migrations/0011_revenue.sql`), and the check is
not application code that could forget: `opportunity_events_reject_suppressed`
raises `P0002` on the `outreach_sent` row *before* it is written, and
`contacts_reject_suppressed` refuses to re-import or reactivate a suppressed
contact at all. `scope` is `tenant` or `global`, so the account-scoped list this
paragraph warns about is not the one that binds. It holds `phone` as well as
`email` — a STOP by text lands there through `inbound::land`.

**The sending domain cannot be released.** `ensure_identity` reconciles on the
domain *name* (Resend domains have no free-form metadata field to stamp the
idempotency tag into), so one adapter owns one sending domain and every employee
sits on it. `release` therefore returns
`Terminal { code: "release_not_supported" }` — not `Ok(())`, which would clear the
binding on a domain that is still very much alive, and not a transient failure,
which would make **every** termination end in the dead-letter queue.

Operationally, with `EMAIL_API_KEY` set: terminating an employee leaves its
`email` resource row bound, with `release_not_supported` in `last_error`,
permanently and by design. It appears in the stranded-resources query
(`docs/OPERATIONS.md` §6) and it is the one entry there you should expect to see
and ignore — nothing per employee is being billed for it. Without the key, on
`MockEmailProvider`, the release simply succeeds and you will not see it.

### Signature verification

Standard Webhooks / Svix scheme: `webhook-id` (or `svix-id`), `webhook-timestamp`,
`webhook-signature` (`v1,<base64>`, possibly several space-separated). HMAC-SHA256
over `id.timestamp.body`, verified over **exactly the bytes received** — the
handler takes a raw `Request`, never `Json<T>`, because a re-serialisation breaks
every signature scheme in existence. Replay window: **300 seconds**.

The secret is base64-decoded after stripping `whsec_`; a plain non-base64 string
falls back to its literal bytes, so pasting the wrong shape gives you a working
(if non-standard) secret rather than a silent verification failure.

## Twilio — phone numbers, SMS, WhatsApp transport

**What it is for.** Provisioning step `phone`: buying an E.164 number and binding
its webhook. Also SMS and WhatsApp sends.

**Status: real, and selected by `TELEPHONY_API_KEY`.**

### The account and the credential

1. Open an account at [twilio.com](https://www.twilio.com).
2. **Console dashboard** → copy the **Account SID** (`AC…`) and the **Auth
   Token**. That is the whole credential: the API is HTTP basic auth
   (`AccountSid:AuthToken`) with form-encoded bodies and JSON responses. There is
   no maintained Rust Twilio SDK and there does not need to be.
3. Put **both** in `TELEPHONY_API_KEY`, colon separated:
   `TELEPHONY_API_KEY=ACxxxxxxxx:your_auth_token`. That is what
   `TwilioTelephony::new(account_sid, auth_token)` is built from. One variable
   rather than two because half a credential set here and half forgotten there
   is an adapter that 401s on its first purchase; the boot refuses a value with
   no colon in it, by name.

Twilio's inbound webhook signature is a **different scheme** — HMAC-SHA1 over the
callback URL plus sorted form parameters — and it is **wired**, since
`migrations/0069`. `/v1/webhooks/{path}` picks the verifier from the endpoint's
`provider`: `twilio` gets this scheme, anything else gets the Svix one. The
reader at the other end of the queue is `main::on_telephony_webhook`, which
calls `agentos_app::inbound::land_telephony_callback` — one phase, because the
callback carries the body and there is nothing to fetch. That function serves
both payloads the endpoint receives: an inbound text (`land_inbound_text`) and
the status callback a placed call reports back on (`land_call_outcome`).

`Endpoint` did **not** grow the `scheme` field this note predicted, and that is
deliberate: the scheme and the ingest are one choice, `provider` already has to
name the ingest (`webhook_endpoints_provider_is_wired`), and a second field is a
second place for them to disagree.

What this scheme needs and the other does not is the **callback URL**, which it
MACs. It is built from `PUBLIC_HOST` plus the request path, so the URL pasted
into the Twilio console must be exactly `${PUBLIC_HOST}/v1/webhooks/{path}` —
including the scheme. A mismatch answers every genuine delivery 401 and logs the
URL it signed over, which is the one line that makes that diagnosable.

### The human gate: the regulatory bundle

**This is the capability no code can shortcut.**

In regulated countries — DE, ES, AU and many others — buying a local number
requires an approved **regulatory Bundle**: proof of address, business
registration, sometimes a local representative. A human at Twilio reads it.

Two things about this are commonly got wrong, and both are encoded here:

**There is no number in a pending state.** Until the bundle is approved the
`POST /IncomingPhoneNumbers` simply *fails*. Twilio does not hand back a
half-created number. So the adapter returns
`ProviderError::PendingExternal { poll_ref: <bundle sid>, expected_by }` and
**no `Provisioned` at all** — a `Provisioned` with an empty id would be a number
that does not exist. Twilio signals this with error codes 21631 / 21649 / 21650,
and because those drift as the catalogue is reshuffled, the adapter also sniffs
the message text.

**Do not wait for a bundle callback.** The lifecycle is
`draft → pending-review → in-review → twilio-approved | twilio-rejected`, and the
status callback fires on every transition **except** `pending-review → in-review`.
A state machine that blocks on an `in-review` callback hangs forever. There is no
such machine here: the caller re-runs `ensure_number`, which retries the purchase
and either succeeds or reports the same `PendingExternal` again. **Polling is the
protocol.**

### What the system does while a human reviews

1. The `phone` resource row goes to `pending_external`, carrying the bundle sid
   in `poll_ref` and a deadline in `expected_by`. The expected review is
   **3 days** (`TwilioTelephony::BUNDLE_REVIEW`).
2. `GET /v1/employees/{id}` renders that state honestly:
   `{"state":"pending_external","poll_ref":"BU…","expected_by":"…"}`. **It never
   renders a green check.** That is the whole reason the state exists.
3. `phone` is **not a blocking step** (`Step::is_blocking` — only `identity`,
   `email`, `vault` and `permissions` are), so the employee still reaches
   `active` and can work over email while the bundle is in review. Its `health`
   is degraded, not `online`.
4. The provisioning loop keeps re-running the step on its own schedule. Each pass
   either buys the number or re-reports the same wait.
5. If `expected_by` passes, the **reaper** files an approval — actor
   `provisioning-reaper`, role `operator` — whose reason names the bundle sid and
   says what to do:

   > *…has been waiting on BU:FR:1234 since before …, which is past due. Nothing
   > on our side will move it: check the provider (a rejected bundle or sender
   > review looks exactly like one still in progress from here), then either
   > resolve it there or disable the channel.*

   and moves the step to `failed`, so it stops reporting as a wait that is still
   going somewhere. You clear it from the approvals queue with a key labelled
   `operator`.

A `twilio-rejected` bundle never becomes approved on its own. From our side it is
indistinguishable from one still in review — which is exactly why the deadline
and the escalation exist.

### Release

`DELETE /IncomingPhoneNumbers/{sid}` is what actually stops the monthly charge;
nothing else does. A **404 is treated as success** — somebody already released
it, and reporting a failure would strand the binding. This is the release
contract for every adapter: releasing twice, or releasing something the provider
no longer has, is `Ok(())`.

### Send-side ceilings worth knowing

**The 24-hour WhatsApp customer-service window is a type, not a check.** Outside
24 hours from the customer's last inbound message, only an approved template may
be sent. `OutboundWhatsapp::FreeForm` carries an `OpenWindow`, and an
`OpenWindow` can only be obtained while the window is genuinely open. A free-text
send outside the window is not a runtime error — it is unspellable.

**And the window names the person it is with.** An expiry alone proves that *a*
window is open somewhere, which is the wrong sentence: a window derived
legitimately for a customer who wrote to us this morning would otherwise carry
free text to a stranger who never did, with nothing forged. So `OpenWindow`
holds the counterparty, `OutboundWhatsapp::FreeForm` has **no recipient field of
its own** and reads it off the window, and an adapter — including the Meta one
that does not exist yet — is never handed a pair it could get wrong. The one
place two independent facts still meet is `Effects::send_whatsapp`, where the
gate's ruling and the window are compared once; a mismatch is
`whatsapp_window_mismatch` and never reaches a provider.

Since the telephony ingest landed (`0069`) there is a way to obtain one outside a
test: `agentos_app::effects::Effects::whatsapp_window` reads the last inbound
WhatsApp message on the thread and mints the proof, stamped with the number it
was asked about. Two numbers it depends on are
**not sourced anywhere in this repository** and are written up as open questions
in the code rather than restated here: the 24 itself, on `OpenWindow::DURATION`,
and the safety margin for the fact that our clock is later than Meta's, on
`whatsapp_window`. The paragraph above is a restatement; those two doc comments
are where the answers go.

**SMS de-duplication is process-local.** The Messages API has no idempotency
header at all, so the adapter keeps an in-process map from idempotency key to
message SID. It stops a retry *inside one process* from double-texting; it does
not survive a restart. Combined with the outbox's at-least-once delivery, a pod
killed between Twilio accepting a message and our `COMMIT` will send it twice.

---

## Meta WhatsApp — the second human gate

**What it is for.** The `whatsapp` provisioning step: a verified business sender
that employees are routed to.

**Status: there is no provider call at all.** Not a mock — nothing. The step
resolves to a *local* routing binding built from `EngineConfig::whatsapp_sender`
(`"<sender>/<employee-uuid>"`, so two employees on one sender cannot collide on
the `(provider, external_id)` unique index).

`EngineConfig::default()` sets `whatsapp_sender: None`, and `main.rs` uses the
default — so **on every deployment today the step fails with
`Terminal { code: "no_whatsapp_sender" }`**. It is non-blocking, so the employee
still reaches `active` — but because `health` is derived from all eleven rows, a
failed optional step means `health` settles at **`degraded`** and never reaches
`online`. Expect to see `whatsapp` at `failed` and `health` at `degraded` on an
otherwise healthy employee; that is this, and nothing is wrong.

### The human gate, when you do get there

Registering a WhatsApp Business sender requires Meta to approve a **display
name** — a human reads it and can reject it for being misleading, for containing
a URL, for not matching the business. Business verification (documents, a
registered entity) sits behind the same queue. Days, not minutes, and no API
shortens it.

The model the code is built around is deliberate: **one verified company sender,
employees routed to it.** Not one sender per employee. Per-employee senders would
mean per-employee display-name approvals, i.e. a human in the loop of every hire.

### What the system does in the meantime

**Today: nothing.** There is no call, so there is no wait to represent — the step
fails immediately with `no_whatsapp_sender` and stays failed.

**Once a sender is configured and an adapter exists**, it takes the same shape as
the Twilio bundle, because `PendingExternal` is the shared vocabulary: a step in
`pending_external` with a `poll_ref` and an `expected_by`, rendered honestly by
the API, non-blocking so the employee works over its other channels, and
escalated to an `operator` approval if the deadline passes. A rejected display
name looks exactly like one still in review from our side, which is why the
deadline exists.

## Browserbase — the browser the employee logs in with

**What it is for.** The `browser` provisioning step: a persistent, isolated
browser context per employee, so it can stay logged into a supplier portal
between tasks.

**Status: real, and selected by `BROWSER_API_KEY`.**
`BrowserbaseBrowser` (`crates/providers/src/browser_browserbase.rs`) implements
`BrowserProvider` against `https://api.browserbase.com` — `POST /v1/contexts`
then `POST /v1/sessions` — and then drives the session over **CDP** through our
own websocket driver, `CdpWebsocket` (`crates/providers/src/cdp.rs`): `goto`,
`fill`, `screenshot`, `expect_hit`, `evaluate`.

The websocket client is `tokio-tungstenite` and the choice is deliberate: CDP is
JSON-RPC over a websocket and Browserbase launches Chrome for us, so a websocket
client is all that is needed — `chromiumoxide` would bring a whole browser model
we never drive.

The CDP driver is attached whenever the real adapter is built, not optionally:
without one, `act` is `Terminal { code: "no_cdp_driver" }`, so a deployment
would provision real browser contexts and then fail every step that used them.
Half a browser is exactly the state this wiring is arranged against.

### The account

1. [browserbase.com](https://www.browserbase.com) → create a project.
2. **Settings** → copy the **API key** and the **Project ID**. Both are needed;
   `BrowserbaseBrowser::new(project_id, api_key)` takes both, and the API key
   alone is not enough.
3. Put **both** in `BROWSER_API_KEY`, colon separated:
   `BROWSER_API_KEY=<project-id>:<api-key>`. The key alone is not enough —
   contexts and sessions are both created inside a project — so a value with no
   colon in it is a boot failure, by name.

No human review is involved. This one is credentials-and-go.

**The shared `BrowserProvider` contract suite is `pub` and the real client runs
it** — `browser.rs::contract_suite`, invoked by
`browser_browserbase.rs::the_real_client_satisfies_the_contract` against a
hermetic loopback HTTP server, the way `EmailProvider`'s and
`TelephonyProvider`'s are. That is what makes a vendor swap provable rather than
hopeful, and this paragraph claimed the opposite of it for a while — see the
section further down that already described the wiring.

### Why the trait looks the way it does

Worth reading before writing the adapter, because the shape encodes a real
constraint. Chrome keeps cookies, localStorage, IndexedDB and saved logins in the
profile directory named by `--user-data-dir`, and that is a **process** argument:
one running Chrome, one profile. CDP's `Target.createBrowserContext` gives a
clean isolated context inside a running process, but it is incognito-shaped — it
dies with the browser and writes nothing to the profile. So it buys **isolation
without persistence**.

An employee that must stay logged in needs persistence *and* isolation. Self
hosted, that means **one browser process per employee**, each with its own
`--user-data-dir`. A session is therefore a unit of infrastructure with a memory
footprint and a lifetime, not a free object — which is why:

* there is no `new_session()`; the only way to get a context is
  `ensure_context(&EnsureCtx)`, under the same reconcile-before-create contract
  as buying a phone number, because it costs about as much;
* `BrowserSession::user_data_dir` is `Option`, and `None` means the context does
  not survive the process. **A hosted provider like Browserbase is exactly the
  legitimate `None` case** — it persists state its own way. `None` is a bug only
  for a self-hosted session that has to stay signed in;
* `act` takes a `&BrowserSession` rather than creating one, so no call site can
  quietly conjure a browser.

And `BrowserStep::Fill` takes a `&Secret`, not a `String`. A plan is data: it
gets logged, persisted, replayed and — for an LLM-authored plan — round-tripped
through a model. The plaintext leaves the vault only inside the adapter, on the
way into the DOM field, and the model that decided "type the password here" never
sees the password. Keep that when you write the real adapter.

## The embedder

`Embedder` has two variants, selected by credential like every other adapter.

`Mock` is the default: a unit-length 1536-dimension vector derived from a
SHA-256 hash of the input. Same string in, byte-identical vector out, on any
machine, forever, with no network and no key. It is a *hash*, so it makes no
attempt at semantics — "cat" and "kitten" are as unrelated as "cat" and
"diesel". Use it to test plumbing (dimensions, batching, storage round-trips,
top-k ordering, cosine arithmetic) and the real one to test whether retrieval
finds the right documents. `Embedder::is_semantic()` is `false` on it, and that
is a branch rather than a caveat: `knowledge::retrieve` skips the vector leg
entirely rather than fusing in five passages ranked by a digest.

`OpenAi` is `embedder_openai.rs`, selected by `EMBEDDER_API_KEY`, and
`is_semantic()` is `true` on it. Three things about it are worth knowing before
you set the variable.

**The key is the customer's and the model is ours.** `text-embedding-3-small`,
a constant, not configurable. That is not an oversight: the HNSW index is
*partial on the model name*, a partial index predicate is a SQL literal, and a
literal cannot name a string an operator types into an environment variable. A
configurable model would be a model with no index — the 889 ms against 2.8 ms
`0026_knowledge_index_model.sql` measured. The bill is still entirely theirs,
which is the invariant that actually matters.

**1536 is the column, not a default.** `knowledge_chunks.embedding` is
`vector(1536)`; `text-embedding-3-small` is natively that wide, which is why it
is the model. The request asks for `dimensions: 1536` explicitly anyway and the
response is measured, because a vendor changing a default would otherwise be
discovered by Postgres, mid-ingest. A vector of any other width is
`Terminal { code: "embedding_dim_mismatch" }` before a row is written. **Nothing
is projected to fit** — a random projection down to 1536 would make any model
storable and would put an invisible transform of ours between the customer's
model and the customer's answers.

**Turning it on does not re-embed anything.** Every knowledge chunk records its
`model_name` and every search binds it, because a `vector(1536)` from one
embedder and a `vector(1536)` from another are the same Postgres type and are
not the same space — mixing them returns nonsense rather than an error. So
documents ingested under the hash keep `mock-sha256-1536`, stop being findable,
and have to be ingested again. The mock's name is deliberately **not** a vendor
model name for the same reason: labelling hash vectors as a real model would be
exactly that silent mixing.

Nothing in this repository ever calls the real adapter against a real account.
Its tests speak the same wire shape to a loopback socket.

## MCP and payments — the ports that refuse

Both are wired to a `NotConfigured` adapter that returns
`Terminal { code: "not_configured" }` and logs it — MCP at `warn`, payments at
`error` with the amount.

This is deliberate and worth preserving. A fake that returns a plausible payment
id is a fake that will one day be believed; `not_configured` is the honest answer
and shows up in the audit trail as one. If you are testing a payment flow and
seeing `not_configured`, the system is working.

**The payment port is now reached from a human's click**, not only from a turn:
`POST /v1/approvals/{id}/approve` on a `payment_create` redeems the approval into
a typed subject and calls `Effects::pay`, which answers `502
payment_not_performed` with `payment_error: not_configured`. Writing an adapter
for this port therefore has a live call site waiting for it — and two obligations
beyond the trait, both in this file's next section: **reconcile before you
create** (the `IdempotencyKey` the port is handed is derived from the Policy Gate
ruling and is stable for that ruling, so look the payment up by it before making
one), and never hold a signing key an LLM can reach. Which rail goes behind it is
SPEC §13's open wallet decision, not an adapter author's.

## The two contracts every adapter must satisfy

If you wire one of the above in, or write a new one, these are not optional.

There is a shared contract suite per trait in `agentos-providers`, and **every
one of them now runs against both the mock and the real adapter** — Resend,
Twilio and Browserbase each against a hermetic loopback HTTP server, with no
account, no network and nothing sent. `EmailProvider`'s, `TelephonyProvider`'s
and `BrowserProvider`'s are all `pub` for that reason; the last two used to be
private to their own `mod tests`, which meant the only implementation they could
prove anything about was the mock.

One parameter carries the only legitimate difference between two real email
adapters: `email::contract_suite` takes an `IdentityScope`, and Resend runs as
`AccountWide` because its sending domain genuinely is one resource for the whole
account rather than one per employee. Everything else in the contract is checked
unchanged. A documented exemption tests nothing; a parameter tests the other
ninety percent.

There is no suite for `Llm`, and there should not be. What the other traits pin
is a *resource lifecycle* — reconcile before create, idempotent send, tolerant
release — and a model has none of it: no resource, no external id, no release.
What does differ between model backends (tool-call encoding, cache accounting,
refusal handling) is per-vendor by nature and is covered by each adapter's own
tests. A suite there would assert that text goes in and text comes out.

### Reconcile before create

In this order, every time:

1. **Look the resource up by tag.** The tag is `EnsureCtx::tag()` — the string
   form of the idempotency key — stamped into whatever field the provider gives
   you for free-form labels: Twilio `friendly_name`, Resend domain name,
   Browserbase context name, a Stripe `metadata` entry. If the provider has a
   native idempotency header, send that too; it is a second belt, not a
   replacement for the lookup.
2. **Return the hit.** One resource carrying the tag: return it without creating
   anything. **Two hits is a bug in a past version of the adapter, not something
   to paper over** — return `Terminal` so a human looks at it.
3. **Only then create**, stamping the tag into the same field the lookup reads. A
   create that cannot carry the tag is not idempotent and must not ship.

The observable guarantee: calling `ensure` twice with the same `EnsureCtx`
yields **one** external resource with the **same** `external_id`.
`IdempotencyKey::for_step` is pure, so a process that crashes between the
provider's `201 Created` and our own commit rebuilds the identical key on restart
and finds the resource it already paid for. `EnsureCtx::retry()` bumps `attempt`
and deliberately leaves the key alone — that is the whole mechanism.

`FaultMode::FailAfterExternalSuccess` exists to make a chaos test reproduce
exactly that crash window: point it at a step, run the step twice, assert one
`external_id`.

### Release, which is the same discipline pointing the other way

`release` must be **idempotent and tolerant of an already-gone resource**.
Releasing twice, or releasing something the provider no longer has, is `Ok(())`:
the caller is asserting a desired state ("this must not exist"), and if the state
is already true there is nothing to report. **A 404 from a delete is success.**

`ensure` reconciles before it creates because a *duplicate* is the expensive
mistake; `release` tolerates the missing resource because a *stranded binding
nobody may clear* is. The write order follows: `ensure` records its intent before
it calls, `release` clears the binding only after the provider confirms. A crash
in either gap is repaired by running the same operation again.

A provider that genuinely **cannot** release something must say so —
`Terminal { code: RELEASE_NOT_SUPPORTED }` — and must not return `Ok(())`.
Pretending success clears the binding on a resource that still exists, which is
precisely how a thing gets billed forever with nothing left pointing at it.

### Error classification is load-bearing

The provisioning engine branches on these, so mapping a transport timeout to
`Terminal` would abandon a healthy provider mid-run.

| Variant | Meaning | Engine's response |
|---|---|---|
| `Retryable { after }` | timeout or 5xx — the provider is fine, we were unlucky | backoff and retry |
| `RateLimited { retry_after }` | 429, using the provider's own advice | backoff and retry |
| `PendingExternal { poll_ref, expected_by }` | **not an error, a wait.** A Twilio bundle, a Meta display name. The resource exists; someone external must bless it. | park the step, escalate at the deadline |
| `Terminal { code }` | a 4xx we caused. Retrying makes it worse. | fail the step |

`Secret::expose_for_transport()` is the only way to the plaintext of a
credential. Put the result straight into the header or body being sent; never
bind it to a named variable that outlives that expression.
