-- 0015_proof_of_need: every proof-of-need check leaves a row, not only the ones
-- that produced evidence.
--
-- `crates/app/src/proof_of_need.rs` drives a prospect's own booking flow twice
-- and compares the panel byte for byte. Anything that is not a byte-identical
-- repeat yields no evidence — deliberately, and that bar is not moving here or
-- anywhere else. What was missing is the *count*. A true positive suppressed
-- because the prospect's site served graduated friction on run two looked
-- exactly like a flow that is genuinely flaky, and neither was written down at
-- all, so "how often do we suppress a real finding" had no answer but a guess.
--
-- Same idea as `supplier_observations` in 0007_sourcing, one vertical over:
-- write the misses next to the hits and derive the rate rather than storing it.
--
-- Three decisions, and the rest is bookkeeping.
--
-- 1. ONE ROW PER ATTEMPT, INCLUDING THE ATTEMPTS THAT REACHED NOTHING.
--    `outcome` is `Checked::code()` on the Rust side, plus `'error'` for a check
--    that did not reach an outcome at all (the gate refused, or the browser
--    failed). The CHECK below is that enum, written out.
--
-- 2. `detail` IS PAIRED WITH `outcome` BY A CHECK, the same shape as
--    `supplier_observations_evidence`: `'not_reproducible'` and `'error'` carry
--    a sub-reason, and nothing else may. A `not_reproducible` row with no reason
--    on it is precisely the row this migration exists to stop being written.
--
-- 3. NO PROSPECT TEXT LIVES HERE. Not one column holds a byte the prospect's
--    page wrote. A challenge page's wording is a third party's text and copying
--    it into a table nothing treats as untrusted is how `Untrusted<T>` gets
--    laundered; the *classification* is ours, so the classification is what is
--    stored. The verbatim quote already has a home — `evidence.observed_claim`
--    — and it only gets one when there is a finding to attach it to.
--
-- Replayable: IF NOT EXISTS / OR REPLACE throughout.

-- proof_of_need_suppression: the rate, derived, per prospect
-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
--
-- No stored rate and no nightly recompute, exactly as `supplier_reputation`:
-- the number is the query. A prospect that has never been probed does not appear
-- here, which is the correct answer to "what is our suppression rate on them"
-- and one a defaulted column could never give.
--
-- The denominator is the attempts that ACTUALLY REACHED THEIR PAGE.
-- `truth_stale` never loaded one and `error` never got past the gate or the
-- browser, so counting either would dilute the very number an operator is
-- reading. Integer percentage, NULL when there is nothing to divide by, because
-- "not probed" is not "0%".
--
-- ponytail: recomputed per query, over one indexed range per prospect. If a
-- tenant ever probes enough for that to hurt, make it MATERIALIZED and refresh
-- it; the SQL does not change.
