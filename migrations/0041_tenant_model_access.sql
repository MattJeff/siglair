-- 0041_tenant_model_access: the tenant's own model, and the proof that it works.
--
-- Until this file, which model an employee thought *with* was a policy question
-- (`0031_policy_models`) and which model the deployment could reach at all was a
-- process-wide environment variable (`AGENTOS_LLM` plus `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`,
-- read once at boot in `apps/server/src/config.rs`). Between those two there was
-- no row anywhere saying whose credential pays. There did not need to be, as
-- long as the answer was "ours".
--
-- The answer is not ours. The product this schema belongs to sells access to
-- infrastructure and never the model: the customer connects their own key or
-- their own logged-in CLI, and from the first turn onwards every token is billed
-- to them. That sentence is a promise until there is a row per tenant naming the
-- credential and the moment it was proven, and after this migration it is a
-- fact with a primary key.
--
-- WHY THIS IS A TABLE AND NOT SIX COLUMNS ON `policy_layers`
--
-- Because `policy_layers` composes by intersection and this does not compose at
-- all. `agentos_store::policy::load` ANDs platform ∧ tenant ∧ role ∧ employee,
-- allowlists intersect, and empty means deny. Ask that machinery "by what path
-- does this tenant reach a model" and every part of the answer is wrong: there
-- is nothing to intersect ({api_key} ∧ {cli} is empty, and empty denies, so two
-- layers describing the same plumbing differently would stop the tenant
-- thinking), a role cannot sensibly reach a model by a *narrower* path than its
-- tenant, and `verified_at` is a fact this system observed by making a call —
-- not something an operator can type into a layer document. A layer that could
-- assert a key works would be a document that lies for free.
--
-- `crates/domain/src/model_access.rs` carries the same argument in full and is
-- where the types live. What matters here is the consequence: this table can
-- never widen a policy, because nothing in `agentos_domain::policy` reads it.
-- `model_for` still decides which model a turn runs, from the four intersected
-- layers and nothing else.
--
-- ONE ROW PER TENANT
--
-- `tenant_id` is the primary key, not a surrogate with a unique index, because
-- there is one credential per tenant and a schema that can hold two is a schema
-- somebody has to write a tie-break for. Reconnecting is an upsert: the old row
-- is replaced by the newly proven one, in the same transaction that stores the
-- new key, so there is no window where the row names a proof and the vault
-- holds a different credential.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT IN HERE
--
-- a. NO KEY, AND NO POINTER TO ONE. The credential lives in the secret store
--    under a ref *derived* from the tenant id
--    (`agentos_domain::model_access::ModelAccess::secret_ref`), so there is no
--    column an UPDATE can point at another tenant's secret. A stored pointer is
--    a stored mistake; a derived one cannot be edited. The store itself binds
--    the ciphertext to that same ref as AES-GCM additional data, so even a row
--    lifted between tenants decrypts to nothing —
--    `crates/providers/src/secrets.rs` argues that at length.
--
-- b. NO `verified_by` OR REQUEST METADATA. The interesting question about a
--    connection is whether it still works, and the answer to that is a fresh
--    call, not an old row. Who pressed the button is in `audit_log`, which is
--    where the trail belongs and where a `secret_accessed` row already lands for
--    every read of the credential.
--
-- c. NO `status` COLUMN. The absence of a row IS "not connected", the same way
--    an empty allowlist IS "denies" one table over. A nullable status invites a
--    row that says `failed`, and a failed connection is a thing this system
--    deliberately does not persist: `Verdict` stores nothing but success, so a
--    stored credential is always one that answered.
--
-- NO BACKFILL, AND THIS ONE IS A DELIBERATE BREAK
--
-- `0031_policy_models` backfilled every existing row with the full model set,
-- because the fleet was already running those models with the operator's
-- consent and leaving the rows empty would have been a silent outage. The
-- opposite reasoning applies here and it lands on the opposite decision. A
-- deployment running today is running on `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` — *our* key, or at
-- best one key shared by every tenant on the box — and that is precisely the
-- state this migration exists to end. A backfilled row would be this system
-- asserting that a tenant connected a model when no tenant did, and the thing it
-- would assert is the exact arrangement the product says never happens.
--
-- So every tenant is unconnected the moment this lands, and no employee takes a
-- turn until somebody connects one. That is loud, it is one POST per tenant, and
-- it fails in the direction where nobody is billed for anything they did not
-- ask for. `apps/server/src/main.rs` and `apps/server/src/loops/initiative.rs`
-- turn the missing row into the same named, non-retryable turn failure that an
-- empty `allowed_models` already produces — an operator gets one message naming
-- the remedy, not a provider error that reads like an outage.
